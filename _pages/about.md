My primary focus is Cenozoic paleoclimate modelling using the IPSL-CM5A2 model. During my PhD at IPGP (Paris, France) I studied specifically the possibility of an early onset of the Asian monsoons in the late Eocene Greenhouse climate. As a postdoc in CEREGE (Aix-en-Provence, France) I have now broaden my scope to the whole Cenozoic, and to other regions of the world. I am particularly interested in the impact of global to regional climate on continental faunas and floras and its role in biogeography patterns.

This work beneficiates from the collaboration and expertise of many involved paleoclimate scientists. For more information and possible work vacancies in the French paleoclimate modelling comunity, take a look at our [CEREGE Deep Time Climate Modeling Group website](https://cerege-cl.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}.
