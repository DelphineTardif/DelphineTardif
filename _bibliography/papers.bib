From the results observed, Topography is one of the many factors that can explain most or only part of the overall observed d18O signal.
It is the main controlling factor in only 40\% of the localities !!
In other localities, other factors are controlling : RH (30\%), Residual effects (20\%), ...
This study only looked at topographical impact. Other factors may be crucial to decipher observed d18O, such as paleogeography or pCO2, vegetation
 
"We would infer that increase in precip linked with the TP uplift would lead to
- overestimation of the topography uplift at sites over the Himalayas and Southern TP
- underestimation of the uplift at sites in Northern Tibet."
 
 },
	annote = {RESULTS (d18O)
First order : TP uplift leads to more negative d18O over the region.
Note : this differences are amplified for the later stage of TP uplift (ie higher difference between MOD and INT than LOW and INT)
Residual processes in terminal stage of uplift are responsible for up to half of the non-topographic processes signals, followed by counterbalancing effects (RH and non adiabatic processes).
 
Impact of RH variations is twofolded
1 during condensation through Rayleigh distillation, increase in RH induce an increase in d18O. This first aspect is more important in terminal uplift stage and only appears over TP and not in North India. This suggest that an altitudinal threshold might trigger SAM strengthening and ultimately d18O precip signature. --{\textgreater} TO BE TESTED
2 raindrop re evaporation in very dry areas has an opposite effect (decrease in d18O in precip). It is accounted for in the "post-condensational" effect.
In initial uplift phases these effect counterbalance each other, but not anymore in terminal uplift phase where
 
Residual effects : interpretation possibilities
- Amount effect (=inverse relation between heavy isotopes in precipitations vs precipitation amount)
Could be observed in highly negative d18O regions  + high rainfall (monsoonal onset ?)
-overprinting of Continental Recycling : original isotopic ratios' moisture signature are shifted to higher values due to recharging of moisture by heavy isotopes from soil evaporation
- Change in Moisture Sources (proximal oceanic sources are less depleted in d18O than remote ones). Further studies using water tagging feature of LMDZ show that continental recycling to rainfall over TP increase along with the uplift, at the expanse of Pacific and Indian oceanic sources. It is impossible to discriminate between sources in the whole residual anomaly, but it seems that change in sources is not enough to have a strong effect on d18O values (CONFER WITH LICHT)

	annote = {RESULTS (PRECIPS, ALBEDO, ...)
MOD simulation (Tibetan Plateau at 250m)
Summer :  strong heating leads to onset of "thermal low" at the latitude of max insolation. This is superimposed with large scale subsidence linked to descending branch of Hadley cell. Both factors act to drive widespread aridity over TP betwn 30 and 40°N associated with very low Relative Humidity ({\textless}40\%). Subsidence also prevent the onset of monsoonal system SAM and favours aridity over north Indian plane.
Winter : large scale subsidence induces high surface pressure and create anticyclonic cells that prevent convection and humidity advection, resulting in low RH and annual rainfall from 50 to 500mm over TP.
 
INT simulation (TP at 50\% of today altitude)
Initiation of convection in first tropospheric layers, which restrict large-scale subsidence to upper levels.
SAM is strengthened and associated northward moisture transport and precipitation increase south of TP. As a consequence, hydrological cycle over TP is more active with higher evaporation rates + colder T° due to higher altitude (adiabatic effect) --{\textgreater} increase in RH and cloud cover + higher snowfall rate + associated higher surface albedo in winter.
North of TP this results in increased aridity (= lower RH and rainfall) over Tarim region. This can be effect by 2 mechanisms : a barrier effect of TP + stationnary waves strengthening , resulting in subsidence to the north of TP.
 
MOD simulation (modern day TP altitude)
Increased RH (70\%) + very active continental recycling especially in summer.
Increased precip are driven by increased evap + water recycling in summer and by intense snowfall in winter.
In winter, snowfall --{\textgreater} increased albedo --{\textgreater} surface cooling
North of TP, uplift induce a RH down to 30\%, allowing onset of large arid areas, principally attributed to rainshadow effect of TP.},

Reconstruction from stomata of leaves in Germany indicate a continuously decreasing pCO2 during late Eocene, reaching low stable value before EOT.
Actually discussion between a stepped transition in EOT or a climatic rebound eocene like just after the EOT
 
Study
global synthesis of pollen and spore assemblages from Priabonian to Rupelian  geological cycles to try to distinguished if biomes held a strong response after a supposed violent drop in marine CO2
 
Results
Globally, no or few changec observed in paleo biomes over EOT
The deep oecean oxygen isotope signal may therefore not necessarily reflect global surface temperature changes at the EOT.
The study questions previous notion of a uniform, abrupt change of terrestrial vegetation and climate over the EOT and a rapid shift from greenhouse to icehouse.
It has been shown that terrestrial coastal sites have strong hydrological connections at the EOT which may mean these were sensitive to changes in currents or sea level fall.
Ongoing orogenic uplift in asia, North America and Europe would have created rain shadows and promoted the extension of arid biomes

consistency between d18O isotopes of mammals fossils between 43-21Ma, leaf physionomy and sst studies implying T 16-18°C.
d13C isotopes in tooth enamel register deviation at 27,2Ma and a strong negative deviation at 21Ma. Combined with paleosols characteristics and reconstructed Leaf Area Indices (rLAIs) this suggest:
- an aridification from 45Ma (1200mm/yr) to 43Ma (450mm/yr),
- quasi constant MAP from 43 until at least 31Ma
- then increase to 800mm/yr by 21Ma
comparable MAP trough most of the sequence consistent with relatively constant floral composition, rLAIs and leaf physiognomy.
Abundance of palm reflects relatively dry adapted lineages and greater drought tolerance under higher pCO2. Pedogenic carbonate isotopes imply low pCO2 =400 +- 300ppmv at initiation of EOT. Arid conditions in Patagonia during the late Eocene through Olig provided dust to Southern Ocean enhancing productivity of silicifiers, drawdown of pCO2 and protracted global cooling.
As ACC formed, and earth cooloed, wind speed increase across patagonia, providing more dust in a positive climate feedback.},
	annote = {RESULTS
d13C and d13O from tooth and enamel do not show big variations during the period 45-18Ma, or if one variates, the other one doesn't... except at Deseadan
These values must be looked in the context of a glaciated Antarctic, which should have risen the ocean and d18O precip values by 1\%o
this decrease could've been counter balanced by a Temperature decrease of 3-4°C or by changes in source moisture (intensity of the westerlies for ex)
the dip in d18O values at late Deseadan  might reflect deep glaciation Mi1 at 23Ma
 
"Progressive isolation of Antarctica and development of the ACC during the Eocene and early Oligocene likely increased wind speeds across Patagonia (Ladant). If Patagonia was already relatively dry by the end of the Eocene, increased delivery in dust-source Fe, Si and P to southern oceans from his already dry and erodable environment(sparsely vegetated, tephric soils) would have promoted higher productivity, particularly of silicifiers and decrease CO2, much as increased dust delivery during the Pleistocene served as a positive feedback in reducing CO2 and intensifying glaciations. The drawdown in CO2 from the late Eocene to Oligocene served as a positive feedback to drive Antarctic glaciation and thermal isolation, ultimately transforming Earth from greenhouse to icehouse conditions."},

Early Eocene (55-52Ma)
SST estimates of early Eocene are {\textgreater}30°C and sometimes even estimated between 35 and 40°C. If these temperatures reflects past reality, tropical vegetation would have suffered mass mortality (Huber 2008)
 
Lauraceae, FabaceaeMost leaf remains are dicotyledons angiosperms. Monocots are represented by dioscorea. Palm are absent in leaf/present in pollen.Ferns frond are lacking but present in spore assemblage.
Stricking feature : unusualy high proportion of toothed margin leaf forms not usually found in a tropical flora. It is normally a characteristic of positive correlation with colder climate.
NB: there are few morphotypes common to both assemblages suggesting that a marked change in floral composition happened between the two times of deposition. Could be due to changing climate or influx of novel taxa from Eurasia. Probably too short to be evolution-related.
 
Gurha assemblages lie close to modern day samples from India (Bandagargh, Sunderbans); Hainan Island (including mangrove vegetation) and northern Thailand ( Sakarat).
MAT 24°C /  WMMT  28°  /  CMMT 18-19°C  Temperatures could be higher with correction for evapotranspiration that decrease temperatures, especially in dry season; Even though, results would still be cold for such a low latitute.
 
Strong seasonality although a bit variating and apparently independent of tectonics (seasonality decraeses while collision goes on). Suggests an ongoing monsoon over India at this time (around lat 10°N). Changes in monsoon intensity could be orbitaly-driven},

ChangChang Basin (19.63°N ; 110.45°E)
Fossil leaves in eocene Southern China present characteristics corresponding to I-AM (Indonesian Australian Monsoon, which is largely the product of seasonal migration of ICTZ. this suggests that I-AM Monsoons already existed prior to Eocene.
They do not present adaptations to modern East Asia Monsoon, suggesting the effects of this system in Southern China were a much later development (-{\textgreater} time of response of evolution of vegetation ??)
 
SAM (northern India, northeastern Indian Ocean)
EAM (China, Korea, south Japan)
I-AM (northern Australia, Sumatra, Kalimantan)
 
"We suggest that across southern Asia monsoon-adapted physiognomic spectra had their origin in climates arising from ITCZ migration (I-AM type), and only later became further modified to specific asian monsoon regime as they developed."
 
Spicer suggests EAM around 23Ma
Quan proposes as early as 40Ma but "because Eocene central belt of China was moderately moist and not arid, reversal in wind patterns might be hard to detect using conventional proxies"
 
"Growth and productivity was not limited by aridity because the mean annual precip was around 2m and the dry season around 1m; All plant-based paleoprecipitations proxies lose precision in wet regimes because leaf isn't constrained by lack of water. Inevitably, uncertainties are high but none of the floras suggests rainfall seasonality typical of strong monsoons."

Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records.

	abstract = {Cenozoic convergence between the Indian and Asian plates produced the archetypical continental collision zone comprising the Himalaya mountain belt and the Tibetan Plateau. How and where India–Asia convergence was accommodated after collision at or before 52 Ma remains a long-standing controversy. Since 52 Ma, the two plates have converged up to 3,600 ± 35 km, yet the upper crustal shortening documented from the geological record of Asia and the Himalaya is up to approximately 2,350-km less. Here we show that the discrepancy between the convergence and the shortening can be explained by subduction of highly extended continental and oceanic Indian lithosphere within the Himalaya between approximately 50 and 25 Ma. Paleomagnetic data show that this extended continental and oceanic “Greater India” promontory resulted from 2,675 ± 700 km of North–South extension between 120 and 70 Ma, accommodated between the Tibetan Himalaya and cratonic India. We suggest that the approximately 50 Ma “India”–Asia collision was a collision of a Tibetan-Himalayan microcontinent with Asia, followed by subduction of the largely oceanic Greater India Basin along a subduction zone at the location of the Greater Himalaya. The “hard” India–Asia collision with thicker and contiguous Indian continental lithosphere occurred around 25–20 Ma. This hard collision is coincident with far-field deformation in central Asia and rapid exhumation of Greater Himalaya crystalline rocks, and may be linked to intensification of the Asian monsoon system. This two-stage collision between India and Asia is also reflected in the deep mantle remnants of subduction imaged with seismic tomography.},

OCEAN
primary carbon sink on moderate time-scale (100-1000yrs)
As the small surface reservoir takes up CO2 its PH decreases, slowing the additional absorption of CO2. to prevent this layer of getting oversaturated, carbon must be shuttled quicly to the thermally isolated deep reservoir through advection (deep-ocean convection) and through the sinking of dead organisms (biological pump).
        These two mechanism can be slowed down by a rapid warming of high latitude surface water by slowing the rate of overturning and increasing thermal stratification. This make it more difficult for wind-driven mixing to return nutrients from the deep ocean to organism in the photic zone (200m)
 
Two largely unexplored processes involving the microbial decomposition of organic carbon, both functioning as additional positive feedbacks might operate during times of massive carbon input and rapid warming.
The positive feedbacks of greatest concern for understanding overall global warming may be those that could release hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes of carbon after initial warming, such as reservoirs in soil (peat) or sediments of shallow aquatic systems (wetlands, bogs, swamps).
 
Experiment : After the cessation of emission and a peak in atmospheric pCO2, the ocean setadily absorbs much of the carbon, although with a decrease in pH and carbonate ion concentration. This carbonate-ion concentration is restored by dissolution of carbonate on the sea floor within several thousand years, but dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity remain high for tens of thousands of years afterwards; as a consequence, atmospheric pCO2 does not return to pre-anthropogenic values but stabilizes at levels at least 50\% higher than before carbon injection.},
	annote = {Source(s) of massive carbon injections during early cenozoic hyperthermals remains uncertain:    - Carbon might have come from deeply buried rocks, perhaps liberated as methane and CO2 during intrusive volcanism.    - could have come from earth's surface as a positive feedback o initial warming.                - For example, a rise in deep-sea T might have triggered the decomposition of gas hydrates on continental margins, releasing substantial amounts of methane and fueling additional warming.                - Another such source is the oxidation of organic matter in terrestrial environments. Methane is appealing as a major source of carbon because it rapidly oxidize to CO2 in atm and ocean and it can be markedly depleted in 13C.
Transient warming events show characteristics indicative of short term positive feedbacks, which accelerated and magnified the effect of initial carbon injection before weathering and other negative feedbacks restored the global carbon cycle to a steady state.
={\textgreater} Stable isotopes and other records suggest that the abrupt and massive carbon input followed an interval of gradual warming and preceded an interval of decreased carbon uptake.},

Analysis of Time domain, obliquity and duration of Chrons C13r, C13n
The redfit power spectra indicate that the basic 3,4m cyclicity corresponds to a 48-55kyr (Age model 1) / 42-49kyr (Age Model 2) period, which is closer to the 41kyr obliquity period than to the eccentricity forcing for this interval which was suggested before as a driving mechanism on the basis of qualitative data from the Shuiwan section that extended further down into Eocene.
 
--{\textgreater} " We argue that 41kyr obliquity forcing is the most likely allogenic mechanism behind the basic mudstone-gypsum cycles in tge Late eocene infill of the xining asin, despite the remaining discrepancies between existing time sclaes and astronomically-tuned estimates for the duration of C13r."
 
--{\textgreater} " Astronomical forcing of climate dominated by obliquity is expected at times of low eccentricity AND at times of strong high-lat climate change supposedly occurirng during phases of incipient ice sheets. A mininum of the 2,4My eccentricity cycle occurs at 33,6Ma, which is above the interval that shows obliquity dominated cyclicity. Therefore it seems more likely that a phase of incipient icesheets preceding the EOT was causing the strong obliquity forcing of climate in the xining Basin."
 
 
Before EOT : apparently climate dominated by eccentricity and precession
Afer EOT : apparently climate dominated by obliquity
This would support the fact idea that occurence of obliquity paced cyclicity in geol records outside intervals of long period eccentricity minima is related to the presence or development of high lat continental ice.
 
Westerhold a,d Röhl 2009 tentatively explain the obliquity dominance in this interval by the special orbital configuration with the "very long" eccentricity minima and high amplitude obliquity variations favoring the nucleation of ephemeral ice sheets and/or the formation of extended sea-ice directly at the end of the EECO (early eoc clim Opt)  --{\textgreater} TO BE TESTED ?
 
According to Dupont Nivet 2007 the aridification could be the result of 1 global ocean cooling, reducing precip in the continental interiors or 2 the retreat of the Paratéthys, which could imply a greater distance to moisture source.
As Dupont Nivet aridification occurs at step1, which corresponds to a cooling it seems that it corresponds to hypothesis 1. However, a 15m sea-lowering is estimated at step 1 as well. So if the paratéthys was already really shallow, this decrease could have been the threshold isolating the sea from Atlantic Ocean.
 
Step1 (34,1Ma) : cooling + European faunal turnover
Step 2 (33,9Ma) : ice sheets onset, Oi1 + "Grande coupure", major mammal turnover, not observed at Xining

Most of the uncertainties come from boundary effect : orbital parameters, topography (Tibet), vegetation, SST
The experiments showed few modifications with respect to variations in vegetation and topography, but high variations due to orbital parameters and SST; Given the climatic conditions during Eocene, Orbital param are more likely to be the drivers in climate variability (such a low SST is unlikely to have existed at that period).
The zonal pattern (tectonic scale) shows a non-monsoonal climate
Asian aridity in the Eocene seems driven by subtropical High pressure regions. To be distinguished fro Neogene which is not closely correlated with pressures;

Evidences of onset of the ACC at EOT (34Ma) and Middle Miocene (13,9 Ma)
 
Opening of Tasmanian Gateway is relatively well constrained (btw 35 and 30Ma) there's still a lot of uncertainties about the Drake Passage, This is the main source of uncertainty about the initiation of the ACC.
 
This study try to show the potential impact of initiation of Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) on the initiation or reinforcment of the ACC at EOT;
They propose the combination of Paleogeographic changes + decrease in CO2 + onset of glaciation = ACC over a period of Eocene -{\textgreater} Miocene
 
Modeling:
Toggweiler and Bjornson : opening of Drake has a cooling effect over southern high latitudes
De Conti and Pollard + Huber and Nof : changes in ocean heat transport due to Drake opening had limited impact at the EOT on Antarctic Glaciation.
Hill et al : paleogeographic constraints prevented ACC initiation until late Oligocene`
Lefebvre et al : Eocene typical pCO2 wouldn't allow the onset of the ACC, so delayed it to the Oligocene},

Resolution : 4,5x7,5° / 18 vertical levels
pCO2: 2PAL, 3, 4
Orbital parameters: ecc=0,05 / obl=24,5°C  / perihelion in January
Tripati et al: small ephemeral glaciations may have existed during Eocene under CO2 concentrations higher than 1000ppm.
 },
	annote = {RESULTS
at 2 and 3 PAL, the presence of ice has a strong impact on the observed flows (more ice = increased flow), whereas it isn't really important at 4 PAL
 
Ice sheet growth at 560ppm increase water transport eastward at Drake and Tasmania, and shift southward the latitudinal position of the maximum wind stress.
 
We can observe a correlation between increased formation of Sea Ice around Antarctica and de-stratification of ocean density profile (through brine rejection ?). This destratification could then reinforce the thermohaline circulation and so the ACC.
 
proto ACC strenght appear as a balance between pCO2 and ice sheet presence. Both should be present to create a strong ACC. In case of high pCO2, the proto ACC could be weaker, even with ice. This could explainb why some studies suggest an initiation later than EOT. The proto ACC could have known some variations in intensity due to pCO2 modification, + obliquity + tectonic aspects},

Late-middle Eocene Pondaung Formation is typical of coastal fluvial-deltaic swampy forest
Paleo localisation of Eocene Myanmar is supposed to be same as today.
Pondaung faunal assemblages and dietary studies are in agreement with a forested environment. Notable absence of folivore species. Growth arrest lines in mammalian jaws indicate a seasonal water-stressed climate.
Paleo sols with carbonate nodules + shrinking and swelling pedogenic features corroborate the fact that it is incompatible with the presence of dense everwet rainforests in the Pondaung floodplain.
 
Two distinct ecological associations can be spotted out:
    - a dry dipterocarp forest assemblage, typical features of 1000 to 2000 mm per year and a 3 to 5 months dry season. "Tropical moist deciduous forest" or "dry tropical forest" in FAO classification (the limit being 1500mm/year).
    - a littoral forest assemblage
 
Modern Dry dipterocarp forests occur in monsoonal climates with marked dry season. This is coherent with fossil Pondaung assemblage and seasonal features found in paleosols and and fossil jaws from late-middle Eocene + the presence of well-defined growth rings in several specimens + presence of at least one primate fossil (Pondaungia cotteri) adapted to seasonal fluctuation environment and annual food shortage period.

Acrocarpoxylon siwalicus is close to modern Acrocarpus fraxinifolius that is a common deciduous tree in semi-evergreen and moist deciduous tropical forest of SE Asia. Itswood structure indicates marked seasonality and is suggestive of moist deciduous rather than semi-evergreen forest.
Bauhinium palaeomalabaricum is considered to be a fossil representative of modern Bauhinia malabarica. It is a common deciduous tree in Indian sub-Himalayan forests and mixed forest of Pegu Yoma, Myanmar. It comonly occurs in areas with distinct dry season, either in open forest or savanna.
Ficoxylon mogaungense resembles Ficus benghalensis, which is an indigenous evergreen to deciduous tree of India and Pakistan and is common to deciduous sub-Himalayan forests.
Terminalioxylon coriaceum strongly resembles modern Tarminalia tomentosa which is common in dry and moist deciduous forests of India.
Sapindoxylon burmense is close to Amesiodendron chinense, a common emergent tree in moist deciduous tropicak dorests of SE Asia.
Bombacoxylon pondaungense is close to Bombax ceiba, widespread in SE Asia and often found scattered in mixed deciduous forests or isolated in grassy savanna.
Shoreoxylon panganense is close to Shorea robusta, a common dipterocarp of S Asia found in large, seasonal open forests.
Shoreoxylon burmense close to Shorea obtusa, grows in open diciduous forests or isolated in savanna.
Shcimoxylon benderi is close to Schima waliichii, a SE Asian evergreen tree that growth in a wide range of climates and soils. In E India, it is the 2nd most  common tree in sub-himalayan open-forested foothills.

Drawbacks of CA : non-specific because of high tolerance of wide climatic conditions of modern species, may lead to inaccurate interpretations because of non identified oultiers, inadequate taxonomical interpretations, misidentification of the NLR and errors in the climatic ranges in modern taxas.

Results suggest that we can obtain a more accurate and enhanced understanding of past ocean temperature structure using modelled d18O(water) in combination with d18O(calcite) from foraminifera rather than the d18Ow correction factors that have been available up until now.

They hold that "permanent redistribution of masses since 20Ma (emplacement of Otong Java and Kerguelen Plateaus), uplift of the tibetan Plateau and the Puna Altiplano have been sufficient to generate changes in Earth obliquity".
Results
good correlation between proxies and modeled CMM, MAT, MATR
Mismatch between model and Artcic proxies is an indication that the prescribed SST is slightly too cool in the Arctic and that two important facts should be noted :
1/ the lack of oceanic feedback mutes the overall climate response to reduced obliquity
2/ the simulation is still missing the forcing factor responsible for generating warm, high lat SSTs.
an additionnal forcing factor responsible for generating warm Arctic SSTs and most likely additional terrestrial warming remains to be identified
 
Antarctica is considered similar to modern Alaska with MAT 0- -10°C, MAP 40-70cm/yr, allowing possiblemixed deciduous and evergreen boreal forest at low elevation inland localities and warmer, wetter adapted coastal ecosystems.

The test done here is
-zoomed area of 35kmx35km using LMDZ4 GCM, centered at 15°N, 80°E, run by prescribed SST as lower boundary condition
correlation on PRECIP between zoom-observation =0,85                               no zoom - observation =0,81
correlation on ZONAL AV WINDS 850 : zoom- obs =0,97                               nozoom - obs =0,95
Error on monthly rainfall : zoom = 1mm/day and no zoom = 2mm/day
Error on annual T° : zoom = 1°C  and no zoom = 2°
No significant loss of quality in the non-zoomed area and increase in quality in the zoomed  area
better view of orographic precipitations with zoomed simulation and significant strengthening of the southwersterly monsoon flow, particularly near the Horn of Africa and Central Arabian Sea with max windspeed of 18m/s against 14m/s for non zoomed simu
Improved Moist Static Energy (MSE = vertically integrated from 1,000 to 700 hPa, high values indicate unstable air prone to convective ascent and rainfall)
Improved Precipitable Water (=vertically integrated specific humidity)
Tracks of the Monsoon Low Pressure Systems are closer to ave 100yr in zoomed cased than in non zoom.
Globally on Western Ghats and Bay of Bengal Region, zoomed simul are closer than no zoom
biases :
- underestimated precip over North Bay of Bengal
- overestimated precips over South Bay of Bengal and NE India.

The Synergy factor appears to be low, which means that the results would've been similar with the linear method. But it's impossible to know this a priori !
On the overall it can be seen that surface albedo (mi-high latitutdes) and greenhouse gas forcing (low latitudes) were the most significant parameter in the Delta T observed.

The very warm climates during the late Cretaceous to early Paleogene (-100 to -35Ma) seem especially problematic, since model results are not consistent with paleo-reconstruction of low-pole-to-equator temperatures gradients and reduced seasonalities on high latitude continents."
 
Models commonly manage to reach mean Temperatures ok with proxies but fail to represent the very low equator to pole gradient that is supposed during Eocene (poles significantly warmer than today, equator more or less equivalent).
The supposition that equator might even have been colder than present led Baron to this conclusion (1987): "The Eocene polar warmth could be explained by an energy distribution, a more efficient poleward heat transport (by oceans for ex) and external factors would not be recquired".
 
Using two simple Energy Balance Model, they compare the warming of early Eocene to the Temperatures pre-ind and try to link to possible causes : orographic effects, greenhouse gas forcing, albedo changes, cloud feedback processes, orbital changes.},

	abstract = {The early Eocene “equable climate problem”, i.e. warm extratropical annual mean and above-freezing winter temperatures evidenced by proxy records, has remained as one of the great unsolved problems in paleoclimate. Recent progress in modeling and in paleoclimate proxy development provides an opportunity to revisit this problem to ascertain if the current generation of models can reproduce the past climate features without extensive modiﬁcation. Here we have compiled early Eocene terrestrial temperature data and compared with climate model results using a consistent and rigorous methodology. We test the hypothesis that equable climates can be explained simply as a response to increased greenhouse gas forcing within the framework of the atmospheric component of the Community Climate System Model (version 3), a climate model in common use for predicting future climate change. We ﬁnd that, with suitably large radiative forcing, the model and data are in general agreement for annual mean and cold month mean temperatures, and that the pattern of high latitude ampliﬁcation recorded by proxies can be largely, but not perfectly, reproduced.},

Three deep-penetration and an additional four shallow holes give a spatial overview of the primarily turbiditic depositional system that comprises the Bengal deep-sea fan. Sediments originate from Himalayan rivers, documenting terrestrial changes of Himalayan erosion and weathering, and are transported through a delta and shelf canyon, supplying turbidity currents loaded with a full spectrum of grain sizes. Mostly following transport channels, sediments deposit on and between levees while depocenters laterally shift over hundreds of kilometers on millennial timescales. During Expedition 354, these deposits were documented in space and time, and the recovered sediments have Himalayan mineralogical and geochemical signatures relevant for reconstructing time series of erosion, weathering, and changes in source regions, as well as impacts on the global carbon cycle. Miocene shifts in terrestrial vegetation, sediment budget, and style of sediment transport were tracked. Expedition 354 has extended the record of early fan deposition by 10 My into the late Oligocene.},

	abstract = {Early synthesis of geologic evidence demonstrated that a zonal climate pattern once dominated China in the Paleogene. The zonal climate pattern is very diﬀerent from the non-zonal modern monsoon climate pattern. It has been hypothesized that the transition from a zonal to non-zonal pattern is related to the initiation of the East Asian monsoon. The earliest timing of East Asian monsoon initiation is suggested to be the Late Eocene, although this is still the subject of hot debate. Here, we use the low-resolution Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-L) and the high-resolution Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) to simulate the climate in China for the Early and Late Eocene and further evaluate the climate eﬀect of topography and sea-surface temperature (SST) on East Asian regional climate. Our simulations supported a zonal/zonal-like arid desert/steppe climate band appearance in China in the Early Eocene, but the zonal band very likely disappeared in the Late Eocene due to increased precipitation over East China. The increased precipitation is caused by intensiﬁed summer southerlies, associated with the westward extension of the western Paciﬁc subtropical high (WPSH) in the Late Eocene. However, the disappearance of a zonal climate band does not suﬃciently indicate formation of an East Asian monsoon climate in the Late Eocene: simulated wind and precipitation seasonality is still much weaker in the Late Eocene and should be distinguished from the modern monsoonal seasonality.},

The code calculates stepwise the composition of the evaporated solution and the amounts of precipitated minerals. Activity coeﬃcients are based on the Pitzer’s interaction model which allows calculation to high ionic strength. The Newton–Raphson method is used to solve a set of linear mass-balance and non-linear mass-action equations. The simulation may be carried out in equilibrium mode where minerals are allowed to redissolve into the solution or in fractional crystallization mode where minerals are removed as they precipitate. Temperature dependence of various parameters and mineral solubility products are tentatively included between 0 and 508C. The code processes all invariant points: those where the activity of water is constrained by several minerals and the invariant end-points.

	abstract = {A coupled atmosphere–sea ice–ocean model is used in an aqua-planet setting to examine the role of the basin geometry for the climate and ocean circulation. The basin geometry has a present-day-like topology with two idealized northern basins and a circumpolar ocean in the south. A suite of experiments is described in which the southward extents of the two (gridpoint wide) ‘‘continents’’ and the basin widths have been varied. When the two basins have identical shapes, the coupled model can attain a symmetric climate state with northern deep-water formation in both basins as well as asymmetric states, where the deep-water formation occurs only in one of the basins and Atlantic–Paciﬁc-like hydrographic differences develop. A difference in the southward extents of the land barriers can enhance as well as reduce the zonal asymmetries of the atmosphere–ocean circulation. This arises from an interplay between the basin boundaries and the winddriven Sverdrup circulation, which controls the interbasin exchange of heat and salt. Remarkably, when the short ‘‘African’’ continent is located near or equatorward of the zero wind line in the Southern Hemisphere, the deep-water formation becomes uniquely localized to the ‘‘Atlantic’’-like basin with the long western boundary. In this case, the saliniﬁcation is accomplished primarily by a westward wind-routed interbasin salt transport. Furthermore, experiments using geometries with asymmetries in both continental extents and basin widths suggest that in the World Ocean these two fundamental basin asymmetries should independently be strong enough for uniquely localizing the Northern Hemisphere deep-water formation to the Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {The inﬂuence of obliquity, the tilt of the Earth’s rotational axis, on incoming solar radiation at low latitudes is small, yet many tropical and subtropical palaeoclimate records reveal a clear obliquity signal. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this signal, such as the remote inﬂuence of high-latitude glacials, the remote effect of insolation changes at mid- to high latitudes independent of glacial cyclicity, shifts in the latitudinal extent of the tropics, and changes in latitudinal insolation gradients. Using a sophisticated coupled ocean–atmosphere global climate model, ECEarth, without dynamical ice sheets, we performed two idealized experiments of obliquity extremes. Our results show that obliquity-induced changes in tropical climate can occur without high-latitude ice sheet ﬂuctuations. Furthermore, the tropical circulation changes are consistent with obliquityinduced changes in the cross-equatorial insolation gradient, suggesting that this gradient may be used to explain obliquity signals in low-latitude palaeoclimate records instead of the classical 65◦ N summer insolation curve.},

Here, they show that the ISMI : the Indian summer monsoon index (I30 N–I30 S at 1 August) AND the summer inter-tropical insolation gradient (SITIG), I23 N– I23 S on 21 June correlates perfectly with the low lat  changes observe.
 
Theories :



Leuschner and Sirocko (2003) and Reichart (1996) sug- gested that through monsoon-induced changes in atmo- spheric moisture content, a strong greenhouse gas, the sum- mer inter-tropical insolation gradient (SITIG) may drive glacial–interglacial variability 
 



Raymo and Nisan- cioglu (2003), Vettoretti and Peltier (2004), Antico et al. (2010) and Mantsis (2011). These studies suggest that the poleward transport of heat, moisture and latent energy is increased during minimum obliquity due to the intensified intra-hemispheric (Equator-to-pole) insolation and tempera- ture gradient. The increased moisture transport towards the poles combined with low polar temperatures during low obliquity is favourable for ice growth.

Using a new calibration of the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) that includes 18 sites from modern vegetation in India, the analysis of 80 fossil leaf morphotypes from the Tirap mine indicates a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 26.1 ± 2.7 °C, a warm month mean temperature (WMMT) of 27.9 ± 3.3 °C and a CMMT of 20.1 ± 4.3 °C. With adjustments for evapotranspirational cooling and underestimation of the WMMT at high temperatures these can be revised upwards to a minimum MAT of 28.3 ± 3.7 °C, a CMMT of 23 ± 5.5 °C and a WMMT of 33.6 ± 5.2 °C. Maximum estimates based on evaporative cooling seen in a modern analogue of the Tirap environment yield an MAT of 32.9 ± 3.8 °C, a CMMT of 26.8 ± 6 °C and a WMMT of 39 ± 7.1 °C. All uncertainties are 2 sigma. Precipitation estimates reveal a marked annual variation in rainfall showing a wet season with 20 times the rainfall of the dry season. This is a similar regime to that seen in the Sunderbans in the modern Ganges/Brahmaputra/Meghna delta.

	abstract = {Monsoonal climates at low latitudes (b32°N) are an inevitable consequence of seasonal migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), but the character of these monsoons depends on continental conﬁguration, orographic expression and the strength of Hadley circulation. To explore the evolution of monsoon systems across southern Asia we compare climate signatures archived in ten Paleogene ﬂoras from northern India, Tibet and southern China, occupying low palaeolatitudes at a time of extreme global warmth and elevated CO2. Fossil leaf form reveals that under such 'hothouse' conditions megathermal early Eocene to earliest Miocene forests were exposed to strong monsoonal climates typical of those experienced today arising from annual migrations of the ITCZ, possibly enhanced by a lower equator-to-pole temperature gradient. Throughout the Paleogene an elevated Tibetan highland produced no discernable modiﬁcation of this ITCZ monsoon, although rainfall seasonality similar to that of the modern South Asia Monsoon (SAM) is observed in northern India as early as the beginning of the Eocene, despite its near-equatorial palaeoposition. In South China rainfall seasonality increased progressively achieving modern monsoon-like wet season/dry season precipitation ratios by the early Oligocene. Despite evidencing weak rainfall seasonality overall, fossil leaves from South China have exhibited monsoon-adapted morphologies, comparable to those seen in today's Indonesia-Australia Monsoon, for at least 45 million years. Together, the Indian and South China fossil leaf assemblages show that the evolution of megathermal ecosystems across southern Asia has been inﬂuenced profoundly by monsoonal climates for at least the last 56 million years. The Paleogene ITCZ-driven monsoon system strongly impacted India as it transited the Equator likely eliminating Gondwanan taxa not able to adapt to seasonal precipitation extremes. Furthermore, powerful seasonally-reversing winds, and associated surface ocean currents, are likely to have facilitated two-way biotic transfer between India and Eurasia long before closure of the Tethys Ocean.},

While numerous quantitative approaches exist for the identiﬁcation of these astronomical cycles in stratigraphic data, limitations in radioisotopic dating, and instability of the theoretical astronomical solutions beyond ∼50 Myr ago, can challenge identiﬁcation of the phase relationships needed to constrain climate response and anchor ﬂoating astrochronologies. Here we demonstrate that interference patterns accompanying frequency modulation (FM) of short eccentricity provide a robust basis for identifying the phase of long eccentricity forcing in stratigraphic data. One- and two-dimensional models of sedimentary distortion of the astronomical signal are used to evaluate the veracity of the FM method, and indicate that pristine eccentricity FM can be readily distinguished in paleo-records. Apart from paleoclimatic implications, the FM approach provides a quantitative technique for testing and calibrating theoretical astronomical solutions, and for reﬁning chronologies for the deep past.},

The fossil wood represents the remains of the vegetation that once grew at the southern high palaeolatitudes at 59–628S through the general decline in climate, from the Late Cretaceous global warmth through to the mid-Eocene cool period prior to the onset of glaciation. This study draws on the largest dataset ever compiled of Antarctic conifer and angiosperm woods in order to derive clearer insights into the palaeoclimate. Parameters including mean annual temperature, mean annual range in temperature, cold month mean, warm month mean, mean annual precipitation are recorded. The fossil wood assemblages have been analysed using anatomical (physiognomic) characteristics to determine the palaeoclimate variables from the Coniacian–Campanian to the middle Eocene. These results are compared with data derived from Coexistence Analysis of the fossil floras (composed of leaves, wood and palynomorphs) and published data based on leaf physiognomic characters. These studies indicate a relatively warm and wet Late Cretaceous that becomes drier and cooler in the Early Paleocene and subsequently returns to warmer, wetter conditions by the latest Early Paleocene. During the Eocene the climate becomes relatively cool and dry once again. The discrepancies obtained from these two methods coupled with other published data are discussed in the context of the fluctuations in the temperatures of the surrounding oceans and global patterns of climate change.},

	abstract = {The Coexistence Approach has been used to infer palaeoclimates for many Eurasian fossil plant assemblages. However, the theory that underpins the method has never been examined in detail. Here we discuss acknowledged and implicit assumptions and assess the statistical nature and pseudo-logic of the method. We also compare the Coexistence Approach theory with the active ﬁeld of species distribution modelling. We argue that the assumptions will inevitably be violated to some degree and that the method lacks any substantive means to identify or quantify these violations. The absence of a statistical framework makes the method highly vulnerable to the vagaries of statistical outliers and exotic elements. In addition, we ﬁnd numerous logical inconsistencies, such as how climate shifts are quantiﬁed (the use of a “centre value” of a coexistence interval) and the ability to reconstruct “extinct” climates from modern plant distributions. Given the problems that have surfaced in species distribution modelling, accurate and precise quantitative reconstructions of palaeoclimates (or even climate shifts) using the nearest-living-relative principle and rectilinear niches (the basis of the method) will not be possible. The Coexistence Approach can be summarised as an exercise that shoehorns a plant fossil assemblage into coexistence and then assumes that this must be the climate. Given the theoretical issues and methodological issues highlighted elsewhere, we suggest that the method be discontinued and that all past reconstructions be disregarded and revisited using less fallacious methods. We outline six steps for (further) validation of available and future taxon-based methods and advocate developing (semi-quantitative) methods that prioritise robustness over precision.},

The position of high rank phytochores was controlled by the global climatic zonality, while development stages of the flora depended on interaction between the Arctic and Tethyan water masses and direction of atmospheric flows and were determined by principal geo logical and paleogeographic events in the Paleogene history of Central Eurasia. Five main stages are definable in development of the Paleogene flora: (1) early–middle Danian with the wide distribution of temperate–thermophilic floras in the middle and high latitudes and their westward and southward expansion from the Pacific and Arctic regions of the Boreal realm; (2) Late Paleocene–Early Eocene with the maximal advance ment of the Tethyan flora to the high latitudes and northward migration of phytochore boundaries in response to intense water exchange between the Tethys and Atlantic oceans with its trade currents and atmospheric heat transfer directly from the tropical zone in absence of the Alpine–Himalayan orogen; (3) Lutetian with development of subtropical monsoon type floras under influence of the water mass exchange between the Arctic Basin and Peritethys with the monsoon induced currents and atmospheric heat transfer from the Peritethys under conditions of the restricted connection between the Central Asia basins and Tethys; (4) (?) late Lutetian–Priabonian reflecting the climate inversion due to isolation of the West Siberian Sea from the Arctic Basin against the background of its continuing connection with the Peritethys; the formation of the semiclosed West Siberian Sea at that time was accompanied by development of a climate with humid winters, hot dry summers, and deficiency of average annual precipitation in the middle latitudes of Central Eurasia, where luxuriant subtropical Quercus–Laurus forests with Castanopsis that prevailed at the preceding stage were replaced by sclerophyllous arboreal–frutescent maquis; (5) Oligocene marked by the formation of the temperate deciduous mesophyllous coniferous–broad leaved Turgai flora after definitive desiccation of the West Siberian Sea and Turgai Seaway due to global regression induced by glaciation (transition from the “warm” to “cold” biosphere).},

	abstract = {The coexistence approach (CA) is widely used to reconstruct palaeoclimates for the Cenozoic. Most published CA analyses relied on climate data for nearest living relatives (NLRs) stored in the Palaeoﬂora database (PFDB). Here, we used more than two-hundred modern relevés (taxon lists of forest stands) from North American, Caucasian and East Asian forest regions in order to test the ability of CA/PFDB to estimate palaeoclimate. Since only data for mean annual temperature (MAT) are publicly available from the PFDB, we concentrated on this climate parameter. Two criteria were tested: ‘resolution’ and ‘reliability’ of CA/PFDB analyses. The CA assumes that for a given climate parameter (e.g. MAT; mean annual precipitation; coldest month mean temperature etc.) the interval shared by all or nearly all NLRs for a fossil assemblage is best describing the past climatic conditions. Narrow, i.e. well-resolved, intervals are desirable, since they describe most precisely the climate. Our results show that CA/PFDB is unable to reliably reconstruct the actual climates of most of the relevés analysed. CA/PFDB performed best for lowland and mid-altitude stands with MAT of ca. 13–16 °C, while producing remarkably incorrect results for warmer lowland stands and cooler stands at higher elevations. This is mainly due to generally incorrect entries of MAT ranges of NLRs in the PFDB. Using corrected MAT tolerances, the reconstructed, low-resolved intervals (3 °C in exceptional cases, typically 5–10 °C) fall within the actual climates. Hence, only dramatic climate changes are likely to be captured in a CA analysis. This renders the coexistence approach useless for the quantitative reconstruction of palaeoclimate and calls for alternative approaches of investigating past climates by means of fossil plants.},

Climatic signals from 11 precisely dated plantbearing sedimentary rock formations in Iceland, spanning 15–0.8 million years (Myr), resolve the impacts of the developing Miocene global thermohaline circulation on terrestrial vegetation in the subarctic North Atlantic region. “Köppen signatures” were implemented to express climatic properties of fossil plant taxa and their potential modern analogues using the principal concept of the generic Köppen–Geiger climate system, which is based on plant distribution patterns. Using Köppen signatures and the correlation between Köppen climate zones and major global vegetation zones, fossil assemblages were used to trace major vegetation shifts. This evidence was combined with evidence from tectonics and palaeoceanography. In contrast to the global climatic trend, the vegetation record reveals no cooling between ∼ 15 and 12 Myr, whereas periods of climatic deterioration between 12 and 10 Myr, 8 and 4 Myr, and in the Pleistocene are in phase with increased pulses of ice-rafted debris in the Northern Hemisphere. The observed sequence of climate change in the northern North Atlantic can most likely be explained by an effective Gulf Stream-mediated heat transport from the middle Miocene onwards.},

	abstract = {Fossil wood is abundant in Cretaceous and early Tertiary sediments of the northern Antarctic Peninsula region. The wood represents the remains of vegetation that once grew in high palaeolatitudes when the polar regions were warmer, during former greenhouse climates. Fossil wood is a unique data store of palaeoclimate information. Analyses of growth rings and anatomical characters in fossil wood provide important information about temperature, rainfall, seasonality and climate trends for this time period in Antarctica. Climate signals from fossil wood, supported by sedimentary and geochemical evidence, indicate a trend of cool climates during the Early Cretaceous, followed by peak warmth during the Coniacian to early Campanian. Narrower growth rings suggest that the climate cooled during the Maastrichtian and Palaeocene. Cool, wet and possibly seasonal climates prevailed at this time, with tentatively estimated mean annual temperatures (MATs) falling from 7‡C to 4{\textasciicircum}8‡C respectively, determined from dicotyledonous (dicot) wood anatomy. The Late Palaeocene/Early Eocene was once again warm, with estimated MATs of 7{\textasciicircum}15‡C from dicot wood analysis, but conditions subsequently deteriorated through the latter part of the Eocene, when cold seasonal climates developed, ultimately leading to the onset of Cenozoic ice sheets and the elimination of vegetation from most of Antarctica. ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Vøring Plateau was a prominent structural feature which inﬂuenced the evolution of water mass circulation in the Nordic seas, and we present detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of this structure. New palynological results suggest that shallow water inner-neritic environments were developed across parts of the Vøring Plateau during early Eocene times, with terrestrial and brackish water palynomorphs indicating that both basement highs to the north, and the crestal part of the Vøring Escarpment, may have been emergent. A transition from marginal-marine to open marine conditions occurred around 44 Ma ago, with the complete subsidence of the Vøring Plateau below sea level, facilitating inter-basinal surface water circulation and promoted a signiﬁcant increase in photic zone fertility. Carbon sequestration associated with such enhanced productivity in the late Eocene Nordic seas may have contributed to declining Cenozoic atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thence to declining global temperatures and the development of limited Northern Hemisphere continental ice on Greenland in the latest Eocene.},

	abstract = {Two hypotheses have attempted to explain the development of Mixed Paleofloras during the Cenozoic in South America. One of them postulates changes in the climatic tolerances of its component taxa and the other calls for the establishment of atmospheric thermal stability (bequable climateQ) at the time these floras came into existence. We set out to test these hypotheses using leaf physiognomical analyses for eight Mixed fossil floras of the Cenozoic of Chile and Argentina. In addition to physiognomic analyses of the complete dicotyledonous flora as known from each site, we also evaluated the physiognomic significance of fossil Nothofagus leaves in relation to current Chilean species of the genus. Our results suggest that fossil Nothofagus leaves have a broader climatic envelope relative to the extant species. This divergence could be accounted by differences in their respective climatic tolerances. We postulate that the Mixed Paleoflora evolved in a subtropical climate that extended as far south as 408S, with relatively warm temperatures and high annual rainfall with little seasonal variation. This climatic scenario is possible only with a much-reduced Andean massif, which would have permitted the spillover of moisture of easterly origin to the Pacific Andean slopes.},

	abstract = {Eocene vegetation and climate data from tropical latitudes are sparse despite special interest in the Eocene as the warmest epoch of the Cenozoic and an often-cited analogue for greenhouse Earth conditions. Tropical Africa is noteworthy for its shortage of Eocene fossils, which could serve as proxies for climate and reveal community structural evolution during the continent’s geographic isolation. In this paper, we report paleobotanical remains from a middle Eocene crater lake at 128S paleolatitude in north central Tanzania, which provide a plant community reconstruction indicating wooded, rather than forest, vegetation and precipitation estimates near modern (660 mm/year). The plant community was dominated by caesalpinioid legumes and was physiognomically comparable to modern miombo woodland. Paleoprecipitation estimates, the first for the Paleogene of Africa, are calculated from fossil leaf morphology using regression equations derived from modern low-latitude leaves and climate. Mean annual precipitation estimates are 643F32 and 776F39 mm/year, and wet months precipitation estimates (all months averagingz50 mm) are 630F38 and 661F38 mm. A slightly larger proportion of annual precipitation occurred in the dry months compared with today, which may indicate greater equability of precipitation in the Eocene.},

Paleontological temperature proxies provide a basis for understanding Arctic early Paleogene climates; however, there is a lack of corresponding proxy data on precipitation. Both leaf physiognomic analysis and quantitative analysis of nearest living relatives of an Arctic macroﬂora indicate upper microthermal to lower mesothermal moist climates (mean annual temperature {\textasciitilde}13–15 °C; cold month mean temperature {\textasciitilde}4 °C; mean annual precipitation {\textgreater}120 cm/yr) for Axel Heiberg Island in the middle Eocene. Leaf-size analysis of Paleocene and Eocene Arctic ﬂoras demonstrates high precipitation for the Paleogene western and eastern Arctic. The predicted enormous volume of freshwater entering the Arctic Ocean as a result of northward drainage of a signiﬁcant region of the Northern Hemisphere under a high-precipitation regime would have strongly affected Arctic Ocean salinity, potentially supporting Arctic Ocean Azolla blooms. High Paleogene precipitation around the Arctic Basin is consistent with high atmospheric humidity, which would have contributed signiﬁcantly to polar, and global, Eocene warming.},

PRISM is organised as a distributed network of experts who contribute to five "PRISM Areas of Expertise" (PAE): 1) Code coupling and I/O, 2) Integration and modelling environments, 3) Data processing, visualisation and management, 4) Meta-data, and 5) Computing. For example, the PAE “Code coupling and I/O” develops and supports the OASIS coupler, a software allowing synchronised exchanges of coupling information between numerical codes representing different components of the climate system. OASIS successfully demonstrates shared software, capitalising about 25 person-years of mutual developments and fulfilling the coupling needs of about 15 climate research groups around the world.},

	abstract = {CONCLUSIONS The summer warmth indices (SWI – sum of mean monthly temperatures greater than 0°C) range from 44.1 °C months to 6.5 °C months from south to north. Site-averaged LAI ranges from 1.51 to 0 along the transects, yet can be highly variable at the landscape scale. Siteaveraged hand-held NDVI ranges from 0.67 to 0.26 along the transects, and is less variable than LAI at the landscape scale. Total aboveground live biomass ranges from approximately 700 g m-2 to {\textless} 50 g m-2 along the NAAT, and from approximately 1100 g m-2 to {\textless} 400 g m-2 along the YAT (not including tree biomass at Nadym). LAI and NDVI are related logarithmically (r² = 0.58, not shown) for the dataset. LAI is significantly related to total aboveground (live plus dead) vascular plant biomass (r² = 0.37), although there are a few outliers in the dataset at sites where prostrate shrubs are below the LAI sensor. NDVI is related as a power function with photosynthetic biomass (r² = 0.62). In general, for the same bioclimate subzone, particularly the more northern one, NDVI and total aboveground live biomass are substantially greater on the YAT compared to the NAAT. Some of this difference can be accounted for by the differences in measured nonvascular biomass. Since reindeer grazing on the Yamal Peninsula should reduce vegetation biomass to a greater extent than caribou grazing in North America, grazing differences are likely not responsible for biomass differences. However, different glacial and disturbance histories, soil substrates, and the resultant nutrient cycling processes could be hypothesized to yield these differences in vegetation biomass between the transects.},

	abstract = {The geologic evidence for worldwide uplift of mountain ranges in the Neogene is ambiguous. Estimates of paleoelevation vary, according to whether they are based on the characteristics of fossil floras, on the masses and grain sizes of eroded sediments, or on calculations of increased thickness of the lithosphere as a result of faulting. Detrital erosion rates can be increased both by increased relief in the drainage basin and by a change to more seasonal rainfall patterns. The geologic record provides no clear answer to the question whether uplift caused the climatic deterioration of the Neogene or whether the changing climate affected the erosion system in such a way as to create an illusion of uplift. We suggest that the spread of C4 plants in the Late Miocene may have altered both the erosion and climate systems. These changes are responsible for the apparent contradictions between data supporting uplift and those supporting high elevations in the past.},

	abstract = {• Paleobotanists have long used models based on leaf size and shape to reconstruct paleoclimate. However, most models incorporate a single variable or use traits that are not physiologically or functionally linked to climate, limiting their predictive power. Further, they often underestimate paleotemperature relative to other proxies. • Here we quantify leaf–climate correlations from 92 globally distributed, climatically diverse sites, and explore potential confounding factors. Multiple linear regression models for mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) are developed and applied to nine well-studied fossil floras. • We find that leaves in cold climates typically have larger, more numerous teeth, and are more highly dissected. Leaf habit (deciduous vs evergreen), local water availability, and phylogenetic history all affect these relationships. Leaves in wet climates are larger and have fewer, smaller teeth. Our multivariate MAT and MAP models offer moderate improvements in precision over univariate approaches (± 4.0 vs 4.8°C for MAT) and strong improvements in accuracy. For example, our provisional MAT estimates for most North American fossil floras are considerably warmer and in better agreement with independent paleoclimate evidence. • Our study demonstrates that the inclusion of additional leaf traits that are functionally linked to climate improves paleoclimate reconstructions. This work also illustrates the need for better understanding of the impact of phylogeny and leaf habit on leaf–climate relationships.},

Analysis of the results have mainly focused on the North African summer monsoon that was enhanced 6 kyr ago, in all models, in response to the prescribed enhanced summer insolation. The magnitude of the simulated increase in total rainfall is very different, however, among the models, and so is the prescribed mean hot desert albedo, which varies from 19\% to 38\%. The appropriate prescription of hot desert’s brightness, in the simulation of present-day climate, is known to be a key parameter since the work of Charney, which has been conﬁrmed by many subsequent studies. There is yet no consensus, however, on the albedo climatological values to be used by climate modelers.

	abstract = {In this contribution, we continue our exploration of the factors deﬁning the Mesozoic climatic history. We improve the Earth system model GEOCLIM designed for long term climate and geochemical reconstructions by adding the explicit calculation of the biome dynamics using the LPJ model. The coupled GEOCLIM-LPJ model thus allows the simultaneous calculation of the climate with a 2-D spatial resolution, the coeval atmospheric CO2, and the continental biome distribution. We found that accounting for the climatic role of the continental vegetation dynamics (albedo change, water cycle and surface roughness modulations) strongly affects the reconstructed geological climate. Indeed the calculated partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 over the Mesozoic is twice the value calculated when assuming a uniform constant vegetation. This increase in CO2 is triggered by a global cooling of the continents, itself triggered by a general increase in continental albedo owing to the development of desertic surfaces. This cooling reduces the CO2 consumption through silicate weathering, and hence results in a compensating increase in the atmospheric CO2 pressure. This study demonstrates that the impact of land plants on climate and hence on atmospheric CO2 is as important as their geochemical effect through the enhancement of chemical weathering of the continental surface. Our GEOCLIM-LPJ simulations also deﬁne a climatic baseline for the Mesozoic, around which exceptionally cool and warm events can be identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {Vegetation reconstructions from pollen data for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), 21 ky ago, reveal lanscapes radically different from the modern ones, with, in particular, a massive regression of forested areas in both hemispheres. Two main factors have to be taken into account to explain these changes in comparison to today’s potential vegetation: a generally cooler and drier climate and a lower level of atmospheric CO2. In order to assess the relative impact of climate and atmospheric CO2 changes on the global vegetation, we simulate the potential modern vegetation and the glacial vegetation with the dynamical global vegetation model ORCHIDEE, driven by outputs from the IPSL CM4 v1 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, under modern or glacial CO2 levels for photosynthesis. ORCHIDEE correctly reproduces the broad features of the glacial vegetation. Our modelling results support the view that the physiological effect of glacial CO2 is a key factor to explain vegetation changes during glacial times. In our simulations, the low atmospheric CO2 is the only driver of the tropical forests regression, and explains half of the response of temperate and boreal forests to glacial conditions. Our study shows that the sensitivity to CO2 changes depends on the background climate over a region, and also depends on the vegetation type, needleleaf trees being much more sensitive than broadleaf trees in our model. This difference of sensitivity leads to a dominance of broadleaf types in the remaining simulated forests, which is not supported by pollen data, but nonetheless suggests a potential impact of CO2 on the glacial vegetation assemblages. It also modiﬁes the competitivity between the trees and makes the amplitude of the response to CO2 dependent on the initial vegetation state.},

We run two simulations with Eocene geography driven by climatologies generated in two atmosphere global modeling experiments: one with atmospheric pCO2 at 560 ppm, and another at 1120 ppm. In both scenarios, the model produces the best match with fossil flora in the low latitudes. A comparison of model output from the two scenarios suggests that the greatest impact of climate on vegetation will occur in the high latitudes, in the Arctic Circle and in Antarctica. In these regions, greater accumulated summertime warmth in the 1120 ppm simulation allows temperate plant functional types to expand further poleward. Additionally, the high pCO2 scenario produces a greater abundance of trees over grass at these high latitudes. In the middle and low latitudes, the general distribution of plant functional types is similar in both pCO2 scenarios. Likely, a greater increment of greenhouse gases is necessary to produce the type of change evident in the mid-latitude paleobotanical record. Overall, differences between model output and fossil flora are greatest at high latitudes.},

The evolution of reptile herbivory and its relationship to mammalian diversification is poorly understood with respect to climate and the roles of predation pressure and competition for food resources. Here, we describe a giant fossil acrodontan lizard recovered with a diverse mammal assemblage from the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar, which provides a historical test of factors controlling body size in herbivorous squamates. We infer a predominately herbivorous feeding ecology for the new acrodontan based on dental anatomy, phylogenetic relationships and body size. Ranking body masses for Pondaung Formation vertebrates indicates that the lizard occupied a size niche among the larger herbivores and was larger than most carnivorous mammals. Paleotemperature estimates of Pondaung Formation environments based on the body size of the new lizard are approximately 2–5°C higher than modern. These results indicate that competitive exclusion and predation by mammals did not restrict body size evolution in these herbivorous squamates, and elevated temperatures relative to modern climates during the Paleogene greenhouse may have resulted in the evolution of gigantism through elevated poikilothermic metabolic rates and in response to increases in floral productivity.},

It comprises Troncoso, Salto del Macho and Río Foyel formations. Sporomorph analysis reflects a regional forest dominated by Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae, Podocarpaceae and Palmae, developed under a temperate to warm-temperate and humid climate. In the studied section, the relation between terrestrial/marine palynomorphs is considered. In the Troncoso Formation, terrigenous palynomorphs dominate over marine elements. The recurrent presence of gymnosperm pollen with Araucariaceae indicates temperate and humid conditions. The Salto del Macho Formation shows a retraction of the gymnosperm forest, associated with the dominance of Nothofagus forest, indicating a temperate and humid condition. In the Río Foyel Formation, the sporomorphs indicate the presence of a temperate to warm-humid forest with subordinate open areas and a remarkable input from the coastal environment. In the same formation, the palynological characteristics, which indicate upward shallowing, allow the identification of parasequences. The bounding surfaces of parasequences are defined as surfaces of flooding which represent a relative sea level rise (marine flooding surfaces). The Río Foyel Formation shows an upward shallowing sequence, indicated by the decrease in abundance and diversity of dinocysts. Different marine flooding surfaces were detected, associated with the diversity and abundance of dinocyst. A comparison of these spore-pollen assemblages with others from Patagonia, using multivariate statistic techniques, yields strong similarities between the Troncoso Formation and the Sloggett Formation (late Eocene to ?early Oligocene); and between Salto del Macho and Río Foyel formations with Loreto Formation (late Eocene-Oligocene) and San Julián Formation in cabo Curioso area (Oligocene).},

The result highlights six major summer monsoon rainy season domains and the mean dates of the local onset, peak and withdrawal phases of the summer monsoon rainy season. The onset phases occur progressively later poleward in the continental domains but primarily eastward in the oceanic monsoon regions. The rainy season retreats equatorward over the continental and oceanic monsoon regions. The length of the rainy season decreases poleward and shorter rainy season can also be found over the outskirts of warm water. Some exceptions exist in terms of the characteristics of rainy season, e.g. the westward advance of rainy season over North Africa and an apparently prolonged rainy season in the Korean peninsula. The results here are basically compatible with those obtained in previous studies on regional monsoons.},

During the same time period, the India–Asia plate collision and the Paciﬁc–Asia plate convergence must have signiﬁcantly affected East Asia, especially East China. In this context, the evolving pattern of vegetation in East Asia and its controlling factor remains uncertain. In this study, 19 published Paleogene pollen records with independent age control in China were compiled and analyzed. The results indicate that the tropical and subtropical taxa and their percentages increased from the Late Paleocene to the Early Eocene, implying a warming trend in East Asia. From the Middle to the Late Eocene, the tropical and subtropical taxa and their percentages decreased continuously, showing a stepwise cooling. The most dramatic changes in vegetation occurred from the Late Eocene to the Early Oligocene in China, which is characterized by universal increase in coniferous pollen. This evolution trend of palynoﬂora in China appears well consistent with the δ18O curve of marine benthic foraminifera, revealing that global climate made a major contribution to changes in East-Asian vegetation during the Paleogene. It is noteworthy that from the Late Paleocene to the Early Oligocene East China was always wetter than West China so that broadleaf trees could bloom and develop continuously in East China. Inﬂuenced by the India–Asia plate collision and the Paciﬁc–Asia plate convergence, the extensional basins in East China developed signiﬁcantly during the Paleogene, and provided favorable locations and adequate moisture for the continuous development of broadleaf trees in East China.},

	abstract = {Prior to the Northern Hemisphere glaciation around ∼2.7 Ma, a large global glaciation corresponding to a 20 to 60 m sea-level drop occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2 (3.312–3.264 Ma), interrupted the period of global warmth and high CO2 concentration (350–450 ppmv) of the mid Piacenzian. Unlike the late Quaternary glaciations, the M2 glaciation only lasted 50 kyrs and occurred under uncertain CO2 concentration (220–390 ppmv). The mechanisms causing the onset and termination of the M2 glaciation remain enigmatic, but a recent geological hypothesis suggests that the re-opening and closing of the shallow Central American Seaway (CAS) might have played a key role. In this article, thanks to a series of climate simulations carried out using a fully coupled Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Model (GCM) and a dynamic ice sheet model, we show that re-opening of the shallow CAS helps precondition the low-latitude oceanic circulation and affects the related northward energy transport, but cannot alone explain the onset of the M2 glaciation. The presence of a shallow open CAS, together with favourable orbital parameters, 220 ppmv of CO2 concentration, and the related vegetation and ice sheet feedback, led to a global ice sheet build-up producing a global sea-level drop in the lowest range of proxy-derived estimates. More importantly, our results show that the simulated closure of the CAS has a negligible impact on the NH ice sheet melt and cannot explain the MIS M2 termination.},

	title = {Middle {Eocene} ungulate mammals from {Myanmar}: {A} review with description of new specimens},
	abstract = {We review an ungulate mammalian fauna of the Eocene Pondaung Formation, central Myanmar, and herein describe new dental specimens. The taxa newly recognized in the Pondaung Formation are two indeterminate bunodont artio− dactyls, two small “eomoropid” perissodactyls (Eomoropus sp. cf. E. minimus and an indeterminate “eomoropid”), and a new deperetellid perissodactyl genus, Bahinolophus, which is established for Deperetella birmanica from the Pondaung Formation. The Pondaung ungulate fauna consists of 29 species (14 families and 18 genera): one species of an indeterminate small ungulate, 12 species (six genera in six families) of artiodactyls, and 16 species (11 genera in seven families) of perissodactyls. Although both Pondaung artiodactyls and perissodactyls are abundant and taxonomi− cally diverse, the former are less diversified in generic numbers than the latter, but are nearly equal to the latter in abun− dance. Anthracotheriid artiodactyls and brontotheriid and amynodontid perissodactyls are the most abundant elements in the fauna. The estimated paleoecologies of the included taxa, the geologic and geographic evidence, and cenogram analysis suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Pondaung fauna was forested/woodland vegetation with humid/sub− humid moisture and large rivers, which were located not far from the eastern Tethyan Sea. The age of the Pondaung fauna is independently correlated with the latest middle Eocene only on the basis of the stratigraphic, microfossil, and radiometric evidence, yielding a result consistent with mammalian faunal correlations. On the other hand, the Pondaung fauna includes many artiodactyl taxa compared to other middle Eocene faunas of East Asia and shows rela− tively high endemism at the generic level, implying that the Pondaung fauna is not formally included in the Eocene Asian Land Mammal “Ages” system.},

	abstract = {The magnetostratigraphy, clay mineralogy, cyclostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy of the estuarine and continental Solent Group (Isle of Wight, Hampshire Basin, UK), which is of Late Eocene–Early Oligocene age, were investigated. A new magnetostratigraphy for the Solent Group is correlated to the chronostratigraphic standard using limited biostratigraphical data, and it is concluded that the base of the Oligocene falls close to the base of the Bembridge Limestone Formation. A long time-series of clay mineral XRD data was generated, which shows striking variation in illitic clay abundance. Illite is interpreted to have formed in gley palaeosols through repeated wetting and drying in response to high seasonality. High illitic clay values are tuned to c. 400 ka eccentricity maxima to develop an age model. In addition to a very strong c. 400 ka signal in the data, spectral analysis of the clay data also conﬁrms the inﬂuence of short eccentricity (c. 100 ka) and obliquity (c. 40 ka) cycles. The succession displays seven conspicuous 10–20 m thick sequences, which represent transitions from transgressive estuarine environments through highstand ﬂoodplains to freshwater lakes. The sequences correspond exactly to the long eccentricity (c. 400 ka) cycles. A sealevel curve is derived using the amount of incision as a minimum measure of eustatic fall, but there is no evidence of a major eustatic drop of 30–90 m corresponding to the early Oligocene glaciation of Antarctica. It is likely that incision was suppressed by rapid rates of subsidence.},

	abstract = {In this study, the lignite-bearing Yoncalı formation between Yozgat and Sorgun, in central Anatolia has been palynologically examined. Based on 37 outcrop samples, quantitative palynological studies recognized 64 genera and 136 palynoflora species in the palynological assemblage, which indicated a Middle–?Late Eocene age. This paper also presents a quantitative palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate reconstruction for the Middle–?Upper Eocene coal occurrences of Central Anatolia on the basis of palynomorph assemblages. The diversified floral and ecological characteristics of the pollen taxa indicates that the Middle–?Upper Eocene formations in central Anatolia were characterized by the presence of a complex mangrove swamp with contributions by Nypa, Pelliciera, Avicennia, Diporites iszkaszentgyörgyi and dinoflagellate cysts which reflect warm climatic conditions. Behind the mangrove zone, pollen of Restionaceae, Ephedraceae, Mauritia, Proxapertites (Araceae) and Longapertites (Arecaceae) as well as the fern Acrostichum aureum occur. Lowland-riparian and montane elements are characterized by the dominance of Myricaceae, Symplocaceae, Icacinaceae, Quercus, Pinus and Castanea. Swampfreshwater elements are represented by Sparganiaceae, Nymphaceae, Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae and Nyssa as well as fern spores such as Osmundaceae and Gleicheniaceae.},

	abstract = {The Sierra Baguales, situated north of the Torres Del Paine National Park in the Magallanes region of southern Chile, shows a well-exposed stratigraphic sequence ranging from the Late Cretaceous to late Pliocene, which presents a unique opportunity to study the evolution of sedimentological styles and trends, palaeoclimate changes, and tectonic events during this period. The depositional environment changed from a continental slope and shelf during the Cenomanian-Campanian (Tres Pasos Formation) to deltaic between the Campanian-Maastrichtian (Dorotea Formation) and estuarine in the Lutetian-Bartonian (Man Aike Formation). During the Rupelian, a continental environment with meandering rivers and overbank marshes was established (Río Leona Formation). This area was ﬂooded in the early Burdigalian (Estancia 25 de Mayo Formation) during the Patagonian Transgression, but emerged again during the late Burdigalian (Santa Cruz Formation). Measured palaeocurrent directions in this Mesozoic-Cenozoic succession indicate source areas situated between the northeast and east-southeast during the Late Cretaceous, east-southeast during the middle Eocene, and southwest during the early Oligocene to early Miocene. This is conﬁrmed by detrital zircon age populations in the different units, which can be linked to probable sources of similar ages in these areas. The east-southeastern provenance is here identiﬁed as the Antarctic Peninsula or its northeastern extension, which is postulated to have been attached to Fuegian Patagonia during the Eocene. The southwestern and western sources were exhumed during gradual uplift of the Southern Patagonian Andes, coinciding with a change from marine to continental conditions in the Magallanes-Austral Basin, as well as a decrease in mean annual temperature and precipitation indicated by fossil leaves in the Río Leona Formation. The rain shadow to the east of the Andes thus started to develop here during the late Eocene-early Oligocene ({\textasciitilde}34 Ma), long before the “Quechua Phase” of Andean tectonics (19–18 Ma) that is generally invoked for its evolution at lower latitudes.},

Global cooling was triggered by a decrease in atmospheric pCO2 and is associated with the ﬁrst appearance of large, permanent ice-sheets on Antarctica. The Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT) is marked by a large two-step increase in the δ18O of benthic foraminifera, reﬂecting a combination of cooler global temperatures and continental ice growth. We measured the hydrogen isotope composition of hydrated volcanic glasses deposited in Patagonia during the EOT to reconstruct stable isotope hydrology and associated changes in temperature during this critical climate transition. These data show changes in stable hydrogen isotope ratios that are consistent with Patagonian terrestrial mean annual temperature decreasing by ∼5 ◦C during the EOT before returning to 2 ◦C below pre-EOT values by the Early Oligocene. This is approximately synchronous with Northern Hemisphere cooling during the EOT, and indicates close coupling of temperature and atmospheric pCO2.},

	abstract = {The establishment and evolution of the Asian monsoons and arid interior have been linked to uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, retreat of the inland proto-Paratethys Sea and global cooling during the Cenozoic. However, the respective role of these driving mechanisms remains poorly constrained. This is partly due to a lack of continental records covering the key Eocene epoch marked by the onset of Tibetan Plateau uplift, proto-Paratethys Sea incursions and long-term global cooling. In this study, we reconstruct paleoenvironments in the Xining Basin, NE Tibet, to show a long-term drying of the Asian continental interior from the early Eocene to the Oligocene. Superimposed on this trend are three alternations between arid mudﬂat and wetter saline lake intervals, which are interpreted to reﬂect atmospheric moisture ﬂuctuations in the basin. We date these ﬂuctuations using magnetostratigraphy and the radiometric age of an intercalated tuff layer. The ﬁrst saline lake interval is tentatively constrained to the late Paleocene–early Eocene. The other two are ﬁrmly dated between ∼46 Ma (top magnetochron C21n) and ∼41 Ma (base C18r) and between ∼40 Ma (base C18n) and ∼37 Ma (top C17n). Remarkably, these phases correlate in time with highstands of the proto-Paratethys Sea. This strongly suggests that these sea incursions enhanced westerly moisture supply as far inland as the Xining Basin. We conclude that the proto-Paratethys Sea constituted a key driver of Asian climate and should be considered in model and proxy interpretations.},

	abstract = {The sedimentary record of Lake Gosiute, a lake that existed in southwestern Wyoming during the Eocene, contains evidence for lake level fluctuations thought to be caused by the earth’s precession cycle. However, it is not clear how the effects of these orbital variations were transferred through the climate system and into the sedimentary record. We carry out a series of experiments using a general circulation model ŽGCM., a lake energy balance model and a lake water balance model to better understand the processes by which these orbital variations could have altered lake evaporation, on-lake precipitation and runoff from the lake’s catchment. GCM simulations indicate significant differences in surface incident shortwave radiation between the two end-members of the precession cycle. These differences cause lake evaporation to be ; 25\% higher when perihelion occurs at the summer solstice. GCM simulations also indicate significant seasonal changes in the amount of precipitation between the two end-members, but no change in the annual mean precipitation. Preliminary experiments with a lake water balance model show that local effects such as changes in vegetation, in snowmelt runoff, or in the area of mudflats surrounding the lake could have a large impact on lake level. However, more data need to be collected to determine the importance of these effects. Our results challenge previous interpretations of paleoclimate that were based on geologic data and simple assumptions regarding the effects of orbital variations on the water balance of the lake. In particular, we find that Ž1. changes in shortwave radiation may have been more important than changes in temperature or moisture in causing lake level fluctuations and Ž2. changes in catchment and lake characteristics should be further examined. In order to make an accurate reconstruction of past climatic change from a lake level record, climate system processes and local non-climatic variables must be considered explicitly. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {The ability to deﬁne terrestrial paleotemperatures is a key issue for understanding past climate states and the processes that produced them. Paleotemperatures are deﬁned, ideally, by proxy data interpretations, and supported by theoretical modeling results that provide physical explanations for the temperatures. Such explanations are especially critical for paleoclimates substantially warmer than present, for which we have no modern or recent examples. Model results and geologic data describing continental mean annual temperatures for the warm Early Eocene Earth as well as other time periods are generally in agreement. However, there are persistent discrepancies between climate model results and proxy data interpretations for temperature seasonality estimates. In this paper we test the idea that orbital forcing and resulting distributions of solar radiation played a role in determining continental interior temperatures during the Eocene. Speciﬁcation of extreme values of orbital parameters (within the range of calculated Pleistocene values) produces a wide range of continental temperatures. These include cooler Northern Hemisphere continental summer temperatures and milder winter temperatures by up to 30\%, and an annual temperature range reduced by 75\%, relative to temperatures produced at the same location with modern orbital conﬁguration. Temperature responses to the speciﬁed orbital forcing are most evident at middle and high latitudes. The results produced with one speciﬁcation of extreme orbital conﬁgurations are more similar to proxy data interpretations than any previous results of these temperature parameters. We suggest that orbital variation and resulting insolation responses must be included in paleoclimate modeling studies that aim to explain proxy data and paleoclimate conditions for speciﬁc times in Earth’s history. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Six experiments were run using different levels of atmospheric CO2, orbital configurations, ice sheet geometries and vegetation types to assess model sensitivity to Antarctica being covered with either a needle leaf evergreen forest or tundra. Simulations using 2Â pre-industrial levels of CO2 (combined mean annual temperature (MAT) À19 8C) are about 7 8C cooler than minimum estimates from the Antarctic Cenozoic plant record (MAT À 12 to 15 8C). However, simulations using 3Â CO2 (MAT À 7 8C) are in good agreement with our empirical estimates of mean annual temperature. With ice sheets and orbits set up to represent early Oligocene interglacial conditions, the tundra climate is significantly cooler than the evergreen forest climate, with local, austral summer averages up to 6 8C cooler in non-glaciated areas and continental averages {\textasciitilde}2.5 8C cooler. In the model this is mainly due to higher albedo and decreases in net radiation and sensible and latent heat flux, especially during spring and summer. Feedbacks between coastal and continental cooling, marginal sea surface temperatures and sea ice also appear to be significant. A review of the late Palaeocene to earliest Miocene plant fossil record in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions shows that the vegetation was in transition {\textasciitilde}34 Ma, from a relatively diverse, mainly evergreen forest to a tundra vegetation. The modelled sensitivity of continental temperatures to a change from forest to tundra suggests vegetation-climate feedbacks during the Eocene–Oligocene transition played a significant role in the initial rapid glaciation of the continent.},

	abstract = {Background
Game of Thrones is a popular television series known for its violent and graphic portrayal of the deaths of its characters. This study aimed to examine the mortality and survival of important characters in Game of Thrones.

Methods
Important characters appearing in Seasons 1 to 7 of Game of Thrones were included, and data on sociodemographic factors, time to death, and circumstances of death were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Cox proportional hazard regression modelling were used to quantify survival times and probabilities and to identify independent predictors of mortality, respectively.

Results
Of the 330 characters that were included, 186 (56.4\%) had died by the end of the study period. All but 2 deaths were due to injury, burns, or poisoning, with the majority being caused by assault (63.0\%) or operations of war (24.4\%). The survival time ranged from 11 s to 57 h and 15 min, with the median survival time estimated to be 28 h and 48 min. The probability of surviving at least 1 h in the show was 0.86 (95\% CI 0.82 to 0.89). The analyses revealed worse survival for characters who were male (P {\textless} 0.001), lowborn (P {\textless} 0.001), had not switched allegiance during the show (P {\textless} 0.001), and who featured more prominently in the show (P {\textless} 0.001). After adjusting for other factors, whether or not a character had switched allegiance during the show and how prominently a character featured in the show were revealed to be independent predictors of death.

Conclusions
The mortality risk is high among characters in Game of Thrones. The probability of dying within the first hour after first appearing on screen was about 14\%. By the end of the seventh season, more than half of the important characters had died, with violent deaths being the most common by far. The probability of survival was worse for characters who were male or lowborn, who had not switched allegiance during the show, and who featured more prominently. There is great potential for preventing violent deaths in the world of Game of Thrones.},

	abstract = {The continental scale initiation of the Antarctic ice sheet at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), 34 Ma) is associated with a global reorganization of the climate. If data studies have assessed the precise timing and magnitudes of the ice steps, modeling studies have been unable to reproduce a transient ice evolution during the Eocene-Oligocene transition in agreement with the data. Here we simulate this transition using general circulation models coupled to an ice sheet model. Our simulations reveal a threshold for continental scale glaciation of 900 ppm, 100 to 150 ppm higher than previous studies. This result supports the existence of ephemeral ice sheets during the middle Eocene, as similar CO2 levels (900–1000 ppm) have been reached episodically during this period. Transient runs show that the ice growth is accurately timed with EOT-1 and Oi-1, the two δ18O excursions occurring during the transition. We show that CO2 and orbital variations are crucial in initiating these steps, with EOT-1 corresponding to the occurrence of low summer insolation, whereas Oi-1 is controlled by a major CO2 drop. The two δ18O steps record both ice growth and temperature, representing some 10–30 m eustatic sea level fall and 2–4°C cooling at EOT-1 and 70 ± 20 m and 0–2°C for Oi-1. The simulated magnitude of the ice steps (10 m for EOT-1 and 63 m for Oi-1) and the overall cooling at various locations show a good agreement with the data, which supports our results concerning this critical transition.},

Greenhouse gas concentrations are kept constant to allow a focus on effects arising from changing continental conﬁgurations. We ﬁnd consistent and signiﬁcant geography-related Cenozoic cooling arising from the opening of Southern Ocean (SO) gateways. Both models show signiﬁcant deep ocean cooling arising from tectonic evolution alone. Simulations employing continental conﬁgurations associated with greenhouse climates, namely the Turonian and the Eocene simulations, systematically exhibit warm deep ocean temperatures at elevated pCO2 close to 10 °C. In contrast, continental conﬁgurations associated with (later) icehouse climates are associated with cooler deep ocean temperatures at identical pCO2, arising from a progressive strengthening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This suggests that a component of the Cenozoic benthic cooling trend recorded in oxygen isotopes could arise directly from changes in continental conﬁguration, and so be partially decoupled from the Cenozoic greenhouse gas history. In this paper we will present our model results against the background of an extensive review of previous work on ocean gateways and additional modelling results from several other global climate models.},

Together, the two major modes of annual cycle account for 84\% of the annual variance and they represent the global monsoon. The global monsoon precipitation domain can be delineated by a simple monsoon precipitation index (MPI), which is the local annual range of precipitation (MJJAS minus NDJFM in the Northern Hemisphere and NDJFM minus MJJAS in the Southern Hemisphere) normalized by the annual mean precipitation. The monsoon domain can be deﬁned by annual range exceeding 300 mm and the MPI exceeding 50\%.},

Previous models have correlated this rapid exhumation with the onset of the Asian monsoon, and/or suggested that it contributed ultimately to midMiocene global cooling via silicate weathering and/or organic carbon burial, and consequent atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Based on published Paciﬁc Ocean sedimentation records and India-Eurasia plate reconstructions, we compare the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) with the paleolatitude of the Himalayas, and show that these converged in the Early Miocene. Because the ITCZ is a zone of high precipitation, we suggest that this convergence was an important driver of Early Miocene High Himalayan exhumation and erosion. Continued northward motion of the Indian plate took the Himalayas north of the ITCZ, which migrated south through the remainder of the Miocene. High Himalayan exhumation and ductile shearing correspondingly decreased after the Early Miocene. This mechanism for increased Himalayan erosion is independent of the timing of the onset or enhancement of the Asian monsoon, which is debated.},

	abstract = {The records of wind-blown dust (i.e., loess) in China are some of the most important terrestrial records of past climate changes, stretching back over the last 10 Ma. In the paleoclimate literature, intervals of increased dust generation have been almost always interpreted as being associated with more intense or prolonged wintertime conditions. Here it is shown that, in accordance with modern observations, dust outbreaks in Asia are predominantly springtime phenomena. During spring, frequent cyclogenesis in the lee of the Mongolian Altai and the passage of strong cold fronts produce the intense windstorms that loft and entrain dust into the air. The meteorology governing such outbreaks is likely robust in past climates. Contrary to the common paleoclimate presumption, it is actually the breakdown of the Siberian High that permits the dust-producing windstorms to occur. The importance of cold fronts in generating such windstorms suggests that cooling of high-latitude climate during the Miocene, or during glacial intervals, might play a signiﬁcant role in the signal recorded in the loess deposits. The unique springtime factors that generate dust storms are an example of why the common partitioning of Asian climate into a ‘winter’ and ‘summer’ monsoon is oversimpliﬁed and can be misleading.},

We show that the hydrological response to the Holocene humid phase in the northern tropics strongly differs from a region to another. The humid period is significantly shorter in the Arabian peninsula and the horn of Africa compared to northern Africa even though its maximum is contemporaneous (11,000-7,000 cal yr BP). Western India displays a specific hydrological signal characterized by the importance of well-developed fluvial systems from the Himalayas and the paucity of lakes compared to the other regions. In western India, the humid peak is shifted toward the mid Holocene (8,000-6,000 cal yr BP). Both marine records show a peak between {\textasciitilde} 11,000 and 7,000 cal yr BP for the Holocene humid period, in good accordance with African-Arabian records. However, while continental hydrological data suggest that the onset and termination of this humid period might have been relatively progressive, the marine windborne records indicate abrupt transitions, somewhat out-of-phase with continental evidence (e.g. abrupt decrease of aeolian proxies as early as {\textasciitilde} 15,000 cal yr BP). Discrepancies between marine and continental likely result from the fact that aeolian fluxes at a given marine location do not simply record monsoon-related changes of humidity over the adjacent continental sources but could be affected also by changes of the source area (e.g., emersion of the Arabo-Persian gulf associated to the glacial, low sea-level stand), and changes in wind intensity and/or direction.},

This work is complementary to the study by Marzin and Braconnot (2009) who have analyzed in detail the response of Indian and African monsoons to changes in insolation at 6 and 9.5 kyr BP using the IPSL–CM4 coupled model. The monsoon rainfall was intensiﬁed at 6 and 9.5 kyr BP compared to 0 kyr BP as a result of the intensiﬁed seasonal cycle of insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. In this paper, the impact of the ocean feedback is analysed for the Indian, East-Asian and African monsoons. The response of the ocean to the 6 and 9.5 kyr BP insolation forcing shares similarities between the two periods, but we highlight local differences and a delay in the response of the surface ocean between 6 and 9.5 kyr BP. The ocean feedback is shown to be positive for the early stage of the African monsoon. A dipole of SST in the tropical Atlantic favouring the earlier build-up of the monsoon in the 6 and 9.5 kyr BP coupled simulations. However, it is strongly negative for the Indian and East Asian monsoons, and of stronger amplitude at 9.5 than at 6 kyr BP over India. In these Asian regions, the convection is more active over the ocean than over the continent during the late monsoon season due to the ocean feedback. The results are consistent with previous studies about 6 kyr BP climate. In addition, it is shown that the ocean feedback is not sufﬁcient to explain the relative ampliﬁcations of the different monsoon systems within the three periods of the Holocene, but that the mechanisms such as the effect of the precession on the seasonal cycle of monsoons as discussed in Marzin and Braconnot (2009) are more plausible.

The two monsoon systems are enhanced at 6 and 9.5 kyr BP, compared to 0 kyr BP, as a result of the intensiﬁed seasonal cycle of insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. The analysis of daily climatologies indicates that even though the length of the ‘‘celestial’’ summer season is shorter at 9.5 kyr BP, the rainy season is longer than at present. Emphasis is put on the impact of the precession on the seasonality, which partly explains why the relative ampliﬁcation of the Indian and African monsoon varies between 9.5 and 6 kyr BP. Moreover, the changes in snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau play a critical role in reinforcing the 9.5 kyr BP monsoon in India during spring. The results suggest that the teleconnection between convection over India and subsidence over the Mediterranean regions, through the Rodwell and Hoskins mechanism, has an impact on the development of the African monsoon at 9.5 kyr BP.},

	abstract = {Based on climatological data such as the all-India rainfall (AIR) for 1949-98, air temperatures in the troposphere and at the land surface for 1949-98 as well as precipitation and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) for 1979-98, the statistical relationship between the Indian monsoon rainfall and tropospheric temperature (TT) over the Eurasian continent is examined by using the correlation analysis and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis methods. The main results are summarized as follows. (1) The June-September (JJAS) AIR has significant positive correlations with the 2W700 hPa TI' averaged for Eurasia in JJAS. The area with the highest simultaneous correlation of upper TT with AIR for JJAS is located in western Eurasia. There is also a region with positive simultaneous correlations in the southern subtropics covering southern Africa. The JJAS AIR also shows significant positive correlations with TT over the Eurasian continent in March-May (MAM) and with the TT averaged over the Tibetan Plateau in September and October. Although some precursory springtime temperature signals for the anomalous summer monsoon are found in the upper TT over Eurasia, the variation in the upper TT appears mostly independent from that of the land surface temperature. (2) The anomalies of upper TT in JJAS are closely coupled with the variations in OLR related to the monsoon rainfall over tropical Asia and Africa. The spatial structure of the first SVD mode for OLR anomalies shows the coherent variations in convective activity from northern tropical Africa to India, while the pattern of the first SVD mode for 300 hPa temperature anomalies shows a distribution which is nearly symmetric with respect to the equator, with variations of the same sign over subtropical areas in both hemispheres and variations of the opposite sign around equatorial Africa. This pair of coupled patterns suggests that when the monsoon rains from tropical Africa to India become more intense, the upper troposphere from northern Africa to western Asia and over southern Africa becomes warmer. (3) The observed temperature variation in the upper troposphere over the Eurasian continent (especially western Eurasia) during the summer monsoon season is considered to be a result of the anomalous subsidence and thermal advection, dynamically induced by anomalous tropical heating associated with the enhanced monsoon rainfall. This study suggests that the tropical convective activity linked to the Indian monsoon rainfall has an impact on the atmospheric variability on a global scale.},

	abstract = {The existence of subtropical deserts, such as the Sahara, has often been attributed to the annual-mean, zonalmean Hadley circulation which shows strong descent in the subtropics. However, the zonal-mean Hadley circulation shows considerable evolution over the course of the year with very strong subtropical descent during winter, but practically no zonal-mean subtropical descent during summer when rainfall over the eastern Sahara and the Mediterranean is least. Charney (1975) proposed a biosphere-albedo feedback mechanism whereby local anthropogenic effects related to over-grazing could affect the radiative balance, enhancing summertime diubutic descent and leading to desertification of the subtropics in general. The present study, which uses an idealized model, suggests a monsoon4esert mechanism for desertification whereby remote diabatic heating in the Asian monsoon region can induce a Rossby-wave pattern to the west. Integral with the Rossby-wave solution is a warm thermal structure that interacts with air on the southern flank of the mid-latitude westerlies causing it to descend. This adiabatic descent is localized over the eastern Sahara and Mediterranean, and over the Kyzylkum desert to the south-east of the Aral Sea, by the mountains of north Africa and south-west Asia. Trajectories indicate that the monsoon-desert mechanism does not represent a simple ‘Walker-type’ overturning cell. Instead, the descending air is seen to be mainly of mid-latitude origin. It is speculated that the monsoon-forced adiabatic descent may result in clear air and, therefore, a local diabatic enhancement which effectively doubles the strength of descent. With this mechanism, desertification can be forced by remote changes in monsoon strength rather than by local effects. This conclusion is supported by the observed dramatic strengthening of descent over the Mediterranean and east Sahara during the onset of the Asian monsoon and, on the longer timescale, by relating prehistoric lakelevels to Milankovitch-monsoon forcing. The latter may help to explain the perceived discrepancies between the palaeoclimate of the eastern Sahara and the strength of a ‘tropic-wide’ monsoon. The monsoon4esert mechanism may not be confined to the Asian monsoon alone and the existence of other monsoon-climate regions over the globe may, in a similar way, explain the observed summertime strengthening of the oceanic sub-tropical anticyclones and the existence of western continental deserts and ‘Mediterranean-type’ climate regions.},

	abstract = {The physical meaning of several different tropical tropopause definitions is examined using atmospheric data from a variety of sources, and model output. The conventional lapse-rate definition of the tropopause appears to have little physical relevance in the tropics, although it is easy to use operationally. A four year 'climatology' of the tropical tropopause from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses is presented. The zonal mean picture shows the annual cycle in properties that has been related to the extratropical stratospheric wave pump. However, there are large and important zonal asymmetries. These include a relatively low pressure and temperature at the tropopause near the west Pacific heating region during December-JanuaryFebruary, and a striking region with low pressure on the tropopause over India during June-July-August. Results from a baroclinic model with imposed diabatic heating are used to support the hypothesis that both these features can be attributed to the direct response of the atmosphere to a large-scale region of tropospheric diabatic heating. It is proposed that the stratospheric pump provides the general picture for the upper tropospherellower stratosphere region, but that tropospheric convection is crucial in determining the important zonal asymmetries in this region.},

	abstract = {We present a new multiproxy (TEX86, d18O and Mg/Ca), marine temperature history for Canterbury Basin, eastern New Zealand, that extends from middle Paleocene to middle Eocene, including the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) and early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO). In light of concerns that proxy-based sea surface temperature (SST) estimates are untenably warm for the southwest Paciﬁc during the Eocene, we review the assumptions that underlie the proxies and develop a preliminary paleo-calibration for TEX86 that is based on four multiproxy Eocene records that represent an SST range of 15–34 1C. For the southwest Paciﬁc Paleogene, we show that TEXL86 exhibits the best ﬁt with the Eocene paleo-calibration. SSTs derived from related proxies (TEX8H6, 1/TEX86) exhibit a systematic warm bias that increases as TEX86 values decrease (a warm bias of 4–7 1C where TEX86 o 0.7). The TEXL86 proxy indicates that southwest Paciﬁc SST increased by \$ 10 1C from middle Paleocene to early Eocene, with SST maxima of 26–28 1C (tropical) during the PETM and EECO and an SST minimum of 13–16 1C (cool–warm temperate) at the middle/late Paleocene transition (58.7 Ma). The base of the EECO is poorly deﬁned in these records but the top is well-deﬁned in Canterbury Basin by a 2–5 1C decrease in SST and bottom water temperature (BWT) in the latest early Eocene (49.3 Ma); BWT falls from a maximum of 18–20 1C in the EECO to 12–14 1C in the middle Eocene. Overall, cooler temperatures are recorded in the mid-Waipara section, which may reﬂect a deeper ( \$ 500 m water depth) and less neritic depositional setting compared with Hampden and ODP 1172 ( \$ 200 m water depth). The high SSTs and BWTs inferred for the PETM and EECO can be reconciled with Eocene coupled climate model results if the proxies are biased towards seasonal maxima and the likely effect of a protoEast Australian Current is taken into account.},

	abstract = {We present a Southwest Paciﬁc Ocean paleothermometry transect using new and existing foraminiferal Mg/Ca data from six Eocene locations from eastern New Zealand to southwestern Campbell Plateau, spanning 10° of paleolatitude (43° to 53°S). Sea surface and seaﬂoor temperatures (SST and SFT) have been calculated taking into account the partition coefﬁcients of calcite and Paleogene Mg/Casw ratios, and used to determine values for the power component (H) of this relationship in foraminiferal calcite from paired proxy (δ18O and Mg/Ca) records from Canterbury Basin. This study presents the ﬁrst Eocene paleotemperature record for the East Coast Basin and, in so doing, shows the absence of a meridional temperature gradient over 10° of latitude during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) and provides evidence for a very weak to absent gradient from the equatorial Paciﬁc to 53°S at this time of extreme global warmth. The application of a new subsurface TEX86 calibration correlates remarkably well with Mg/Ca seaﬂoor temperature trends from the continental slope setting (b 1000 m paleodepth) of the sites sampled in this study, suggesting that TEX86 is recording an upper ocean subsurface temperature record, rather than simply SST values. SST-SFT gradients demonstrate a notable reduction, decreasing to 3–5 °C across the EECO. The comparable ocean temperatures of the East Coast Basin, Canterbury Basin and DSDP Site 277 during this time support the intensiﬁcation of a proto-East Australian Current (EAC), explaining the distribution of tropical sea temperatures extending into the high-latitude Southwest Paciﬁc Ocean during the EECO. Seaﬂoor temperatures ({\textasciitilde}1000 m paleodepth) likely correspond to a northern, intermediate water source during the early Eocene, before switching to a cooler southern-derived source in the middle to late Eocene.},

Analysis of environmental samples over the last decade has shown, however, that their structural diversity and sources are much wider than anticipated and that they occur ubiquitously in a wide range of environments, such as oceans and lakes, and their (sub)surface sediments, as well as soils. Several GDGTs have been unambiguously identiﬁed and can be used as biomarker lipids, since they are preserved in immature sediments {\textless}140 Ma. Close examination of the distributions has led to the discovery that GDGTs might be used as proxies for certain environmental parameters, such as the input of soil organic matter to marine environments, soil pH, air temperature and sea and lake water temperature. Here, we review the progress made over the last decade in the analysis, occurrence and recognition of sources of GDGTs, their applications as biomarker lipids, and the development and application of proxies based on their distributions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the TEX86 palaeothermometer for sea surface temperature (SST) and evaluate its application to the Palaeogene, with a focus on the principal ecological, physical or chemical processes that can bias glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) distributions. Recent investigations of Palaeogene sediments have revealed temperature offsets between two different GDGT-based approaches, TEXL86 and TEX8H6, with the former agreeing with SST estimates derived from inorganic proxies (Hollis et al., 2012). These are surprising observations because the two GDGT approaches, although based on two distinct groups of compounds, apparently agree at SSTs N 15 °C in modern oceans. Here we reassess the relationship between raw GDGT distributions and the ratios used to construct TEXH86 and TEX86 in both the modern core-top dataset and a new compilation of Palaeogene data. We show that the offset between TEX8H6 and TEX8L6 (ΔH–L) is a function of the GDGT-2/GDGT-3 ratio ([2]/[3] ratio), and that this can be used to separate low- and high-latitude GDGT distributions in the modern core-top dataset: a range of [2]/[3] ratios and ΔH–L values occur in polar regions, whereas [2]/[3] ratios are high and ΔH–L values are small at temperatures N 15 °C. However, in the Palaeogene dataset, we observe a wide range of [2]/[3] ratios, even for SST estimates above 15 °C. Crucially, we ﬁnd that water depth is a better discriminator of ΔH–L values and [2]/[3] ratios than SST in the combined modern and Palaeogene dataset: ΔH–L values are low (b3.0 °C) and [2]/[3] ratios are high (N5.0) where water depth is N1000 m.},

	abstract = {The stratospheric ozone layer plays a key role in atmospheric thermal structure and circulation. Although stratospheric ozone distribution is sensitive to changes in trace gases concentrations and climate, the modiﬁcations of stratospheric ozone are not usually considered in climate studies at geological timescales. Here, we evaluate the potential role of stratospheric ozone chemistry in the case of the Eocene hot conditions. Using a chemistry–climate model, we show that the structure of the ozone layer is signiﬁcantly different under these conditions (4×CO2 climate and high concentrations of tropospheric N2O and CH4). The total column ozone (TCO) remains more or less unchanged in the tropics whereas it is found to be enhanced at mid- and high latitudes. These ozone changes are related to the stratospheric cooling and an acceleration of stratospheric Brewer–Dobson circulation simulated under Eocene climate. As a consequence, the meridional distribution of the TCO appears to be modiﬁed, showing particularly pronounced midlatitude maxima and a steeper negative poleward gradient from these maxima. These anomalies are consistent with changes in the seasonal evolution of the polar vortex during winter, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, found to be mainly driven by seasonal changes in planetary wave activity and stratospheric wavedrag. Compared to a preindustrial atmospheric composition, the changes in local ozone concentration reach up to 40 \% for zonal annual mean and affect temperature by a few kelvins in the middle stratosphere.},

	abstract = {Earth’s sand seas (dune fields) experience winds that blow with different strengths and from different directions in line with the seasons. In response, dune fields show a rich variety of shapes, from crescentic barchans to star and linear dunes. These dunes commonly exhibit complex and compound patterns with a range of length scales and various orientations, which up to now have remained difficult to relate to wind cycles. Here, we develop a model for dune orientation that explains the coexistence of bedforms with different alignments in multidirectional wind regimes. This model derives from subaqueous experiments, which show that a single bidirectional flow regime can lead to two different dune orientations depending on sediment availability, i.e., the erodibility of the bed. Sediment availability selects the overriding mechanism for the formation of dunes: increasing in height from the destabilization of a sand bed (with no restriction in sediment availability) or elongating in a finger on a nonerodible surface from a localized sand source. These mechanisms drive the dune orientation. Therefore, dune alignment maximizes dune orthogonality to sand fluxes in the bed instability mode, while dunes are aligned with the mean sand transport direction in the fingering mode. Applied to Earth’s deserts, the model quantitatively predicts the orientation of rectilinear dunes and their superimposed patterns. This field study suggests that many linear dunes on Earth elongate from sources, and are simply aligned with the mean sand transport direction.},

When emerged, this wide continental platform in the heart of the Maritime Continent may have modiﬁed regional and global climate systems. We investigate the effect of the exposure of the Sunda shelf on climate dynamics using a set of numerical simulations with (i) atmosphere‐land surface and (ii) fully coupled general circulation models. We ﬁrst explore the impact of convection schemes on the rainfall regime simulated over the Maritime Continent and show how they could explain the discrepancies among previous studies. We further depict a robust and common mechanism that prevails. We show that diurnal heating of the surface of the continental platform enhances low‐level convergence and local convection, and fosters local precipitations. This effect, to a second order, is modulated by the radiative effect and increased turbulent heat ﬂux driven by vegetated surface properties such as albedo or roughness. Increasing precipitations over the exposed platform also impacts freshwater export into seawater, making salinity of the Indian Ocean and Indonesian Throughﬂow highly dependent on the routing scheme over the exposed shelf.},

	abstract = {Today, the hydrological regime in East and South Asia is dominated by the monsoons, whilst central Asia is characterized as arid. Studies that have examined the onset of aridity and the intensiﬁcation of the monsoons in Asia have generated signiﬁcant debate, especially in respect to the timing of monsoon onset and how this relates to the potential causal mechanisms. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, the retreat of the Paratethys Sea, and the global cooling after the Eocene/Oligocene transition are all considered major drivers of Asian aridity and monsoonal intensiﬁcation. However, little is known about each of these factor’s contribution to the development of modern monsoon behaviour. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we perform sensitivity simulations of a fully coupled ocean–atmosphere climate model (HadCM3) to investigate the effect of the Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets formation, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) variability, and Tibetan Plateau uplift on East Central Asian aridity and monsoon driven precipitation. We focus on three individual regions, the South Asian Monsoon, the East Asian Monsoon and the Arid East Central Asia and we present the annual precipitation cycle and the moisture availability over each region. Our results show that of the parameters investigated the primary control on Asian hydroclimate is the topography of the Tibetan Plateau. Furthermore, our results highlight that the signiﬁcance of each forcing depends on the component of the hydrological region and factors studied, a factor that proxy interpretation need to take into consideration.},

On the other hand, the depicted biotic events have been controlled by successive tectonic, paleogeographic, and paleoclimatic events, because organisms determining contents of biostratigraphic zones changed not only in the course of evolution, but also in response to transformation of surroundings. As elements of general communication systems, epicontinental seas of the Paleogene have been interconnected via straits and seaways, which promoted interchange of water masses and biotas belonging to the Tethys, Atlantic or Arctic oceans, and inner seas. Size and conﬁguration of the seas and seaways changed under inﬂuence of tectonic processes and eustatic events of epeirogenic or regional origin. Widening, narrowing, and cessation of communication ways have been responsible for different-scale changes in sedimentation and biotic environments. New materials on the Paleogene in a vast territory of Russian sector of West Eurasia offer an opportunity to revise somewhat the dynamics of climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere during the Early Cenozoic, which characterize the terminal phase of transition from the warm to cold biosphere of the Earth.},

The Rovno amber from NW Ukraine resembles in many aspects the Baltic amber; however, only fossilized animals and some bryophytes have yet been studied from the Rovno amber. We provide the first detailed description of an angiosperm flower from Rovno amber. The flower is staminate with conspicuous hypanthium, double pentamerous perianth and whorled androecium of 24 stamens much longer than the petals. Sepals are sparsely pubescent and petals are densely hirsute outside. The fossil shares important features with extant members of Prunus subgen. Padus s. l. (incl. Laurocerasus, Pygeum and Maddenia), especially with its evergreen paleotropical species. It is described here as a new species Prunus hirsutipetala D.D.Sokoloff, Remizowa et Nuraliev. Our study provides the first convincing record of fossil flowers of Rosaceae from Eocene of Europe and the earliest fossil flower of Prunus outside North America. Our record of a plant resembling extant tropical species supports palaeoentomological evidences for warm winters in northwestern Ukraine during the late Eocene, as well as suggesting a more significant role of tropical insects in Rovno amber than inferred from Baltic amber.},

	abstract = {The timing of initiation of continent-continent collision between Asia and India is controversial, but this major tectonic event is generally thought to have occurred in the Early Eocene, ca. 50 Ma. New and independent data from strontium isotopes, stable carbon isotopes, microfossil biostratigraphy, and mammal fossils from an Early Eocene marginal marine sequence (Cambay Shale) at the Vastan Lignite Mine of western India indicate that terrestrial faunal exchanges, and therefore continental collision, between Asia and the Indian subcontinent took place before 53.7 Ma. This age coincides with the second Eocene Thermal Maximum (ETM2), a short-lived warming episode that followed the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) ca. 55.5 Ma. Our data also document, for the ﬁrst time, a clear record of the ETM2 in terrestrial organic material from a lowlatitude site, which is represented by a 3‰−4‰ carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in lignite and dispersed organic carbon δ13C values. The magnitude of the CIE at this location closely matches that observed in marine cores from the Arctic Ocean, which supports an interpretation that this hyperthermal event, though of lower magnitude, was similar in character to that of the PETM, being a global phenomenon that affected both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The role of the palaeogeography on the geological evolution of the global carbon cycle has been suspected since the development of the ﬁrst global geochemical models in the early 80s. The palaeogeography has been rapidly recognized as a key factor controlling the long-term evolution of the atmospheric CO2 through its capability of modulating the efﬁciency of the silicate weathering. First the role of the latitudinal position of the continents has been emphasized: an averaged low latitudinal position promotes the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering, and is theoretically associated to low CO2 periods. With the increase of model complexity and the explicit consideration of the hydrological cycle, the importance of the continentality factor has been recognized: periods of supercontinent assembly coincide with high pCO2 values due to the development of arid conditions which weaken the silicate weathering efﬁciency. These fundamental feedbacks between climate, carbon cycle and tectonic have been discovered by pioneer modelling studies and opened new views in the understanding of the history of Earth's climate. Today, some of the key features of the Phanerozoic climate can be explained by: (1) continental drift; (2) small continental blocks moving to tropical belts; and (3) modulation of the climate sensitivity to CO2 by palaeogeography changes. Those results emphasize the need for a careful process-based modelling of the water cycle and climate response to the continental drift.},

	abstract = {The Cenozoic is a period of major climatic changes marked by the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet at the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary. The opening of the southern ocean seaways and the decrease in atmospheric CO2 are two processes generally evoked to explain this E/O cooling. The debate is still ongoing but modeling studies tend to demonstrate that the decrease in atmospheric CO2 is the main driver of the cooling. However, uncertainties persist on what drove the decrease in atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic. In this study, we investigate the impact of continental drift, lithology distribution and volcanic degassing rates on the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the Cenozoic within a coupled climate-carbon model (GEOCLIM). In the model, the continental drift results in driving low atmospheric CO2 levels during the Eocene and the Oligocene. The dispersed conﬁguration and the location of a large continental area (North Africa, northern South America) within the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) promote CO2 consumption by weathering, forcing CO2 to remain low. Icehouse conditions are also promoted by the drifting of India and the weathering of the Deccan basalts in the ITCZ during the Eocene, and by the weathering of the Ethiopian traps during the Oligocene. To prevent the building up of the Antarctic ice sheet at the Eocene, the model needs enhanced solid Earth degassing ﬂux by 50\% so that atmospheric CO2 levels stay above the glacial threshold (750 ppm). We ﬁnd that the decrease in atmospheric CO2 from the Eocene to the Oligocene is probably due to a reduction in the source of volcanic CO2 rather than an increase in silicate weathering. The model results furthermore suggest that during the Miocene period, the northward drifting of both the African plate and India (including the Deccan traps) might have decreased the continental surface exposed to chemical weathering, therefore generating higher CO2 values. Finally, the uplift of the Tibetan plateau from the Miocene to the present-day induces in the model an increase in silicate weathering through the intensiﬁcation of the South-Eastern Asian monsoon, causing atmospheric CO2 to come back to a pre-industrial value.},

	abstract = {A signiﬁcant number of new palaeomagnetic poles have become available since the last time a compilation was made (assembled in 2005, published in 2008) to indicate to us that a new and signiﬁcantly expanded set of tables with palaeomagnetic results would be valuable, with results coming from the Gondwana cratonic elements, Laurentia, Baltica/Europe, and Siberia. Following the Silurian Caledonian Orogeny, Laurentia's and Baltica's Apparent Polar Wander Paths (APWPs) can be merged into a Laurussia path, followed in turn by a merger of the Laurussia and Siberia data from latest Permian time onward into a Laurasian combined path. Meanwhile, after about 320 Ma, Gondwana's and Laurussia/Laurasia's path can be combined into what comes steadily closer to the ideal of a Global Apparent Polar Wander Path (GAPWaP) for late Palaeozoic and younger times. Tests for True Polar Wander (TPW) episodes are now feasible since Pangaea fusion and we identify four important episodes of Mesozoic TPW between 250 and 100 Ma. TPW rates are in the order of 0.45–0.8°/M.y. but cumulative TPW is nearly zero since the Late Carboniferous. With the exception of a few intervals where data are truly scarce (e.g., 390–340 Ma), the palaeomagnetic database is robust and allows us to make a series of new palaeogeographic reconstructions from the Late Cambrian to the Palaeogene.},

	abstract = {Ongoing controversies on the timing and kinematics of the Indo–Asia collision can be solved by palaeomagnetically determined palaeolatitudes of terranes bounding the Indo–Asia suture zone. We show here, based on new palaeomagnetic data from the Linzizong volcanic rocks (54–47 Ma) near the city of Lhasa, that the latitude of the southern margin of Asia was 22.8 ± 4.2◦N when these rocks were deposited. This result, combined with revised palaeomagnetic results from the northernmost sedimentary units of Greater India and with apparent polar wander paths of India and Eurasia, palaeomagnetically constrain the collision to have occurred at 46 ± 8 Ma (95 per cent conﬁdence interval). These palaeomagnetic results are consistent with tomographic anomalies at 15–25◦N that are interpreted to locate the Tethyan oceanic slab that detached following collision, and with independent 56–46 Ma collision age estimates inferred from the timing of slowing down of India, high pressure metamorphism, the end of marine sedimentation and the ﬁrst occurrence of suture zone and arc detritus on the Greater Indian margin. When compared with apparent polar wander paths of India and Eurasia, the ∼46 Ma onset of collision at 22.8 ± 4.2◦N implies 2900 ± 600 km subsequent latitudinal convergence between India and Asia divided into 1100 ± 500 km within Asia and 1800 ± 700 km within India.},

Of the states comprising the mid-Pleistocene to recent climatic regime, interglacials are most similar in terms of high latitude ice volumes and temperatures to those extant during the late Miocene and early Pliocene. Thus, an important question is whether Mio-Pliocene climates in northern China were analogous to a hypothetical ‘prolonged interglacial state,’ with increased summer monsoon precipitation and expansion of forest and steppe environments at the expense of desert environments.},

	abstract = {The main phases of plant dispersal into, and out of the South-East Asian region are discussed in relation to plate tectonics and changing climates. The South-East Asian area was a backwater of angiosperm evolution until the collision of the Indian Plate with Asia during the early Cenozoic. The Late Cretaceous remains poorly understood, but the Paleocene topography was mountainous, and the climate was probably seasonally dry, with the result that frosttolerant conifers were common in upland areas and a low-diversity East Asian aspect flora occurred at low altitudes. India’s drift into the perhumid low latitudes during the Eocene brought opportunities for the dispersal into South-East Asia of diverse groups of megathermal angiosperms which originated in West Gondwana. They successfully dispersed and became established across the South-East Asian region, initially carried by wind or birds, beginning at about 49 Ma, and with a terrestrial connection after about 41 Ma. Many Paleocene lineages probably went extinct, but a few dispersed in the opposite direction into India. The Oligocene was a time of seasonally dry climates except along the eastern and southern seaboard of Sundaland, but with the collision of the Australian Plate with Sunda at the end of the Oligocene widespread perhumid conditions became established across the region. The uplift of the Himalaya, coinciding with the middle Miocene thermal maximum, created opportunities for South-East Asian evergreen taxa to disperse into north India, and then with the late Miocene strengthening of the Indian monsoon, seasonally dry conditions expanded across India and Indochina, resulting eventually in the disappearance of closed forest over much of the Indian peninsula. This drying affected Sunda, but it is thought unlikely that a ‘savanna’ corridor was present across Sunda during the Pleistocene. Some dispersals from Australasia occurred following its collision with Sunda and following the uplift of New Guinea and the islands of Wallacea, Gondwanan montane taxa also found their way into the region. Phases of uplift across the Sunda region created opportunities for allopatric speciation and further dispersal opportunities. There is abundant evidence to suggest that the Pleistocene refuge theory applies to the South-East Asian region.},

	abstract = {To date, many general circulation model (GCM) experiments have failed to reproduce the warm, high latitude temperatures suggested for the Cretaceous by geological proxy climate indicators, especially for the Northern Hemisphere and within continental interiors. The vast majority of these proxies are biologically based, and it is important to determine whether alternative sedimentologically based proxies indicate similar cold biases in models. Therefore, we have performed an evaluation of the very latest generation of climate model predictions for terrestrial sites using climatically sensitive sediments as palaeoclimate indicators. Evidence from the geological record, comprising coal/peat, evaporites, bauxite and laterite deposits, are portrayed on a series of palaeoclimate-data maps. These are then compared with the global distributions of potential deposits generated from model simulations of the Maastrichtian using versions of the Hadley Centre climate model. The Maastrichtian was chosen because of the greater range and sophistication of GCMs adapted for its climate simulation and sediment prediction than for other Cretaceous stages. This thus represents the ﬁrst attempt at comparing such state-of-the-art models to lithological climate indicators and quantifying their relative performances.},

This interval is associated with a signiﬁcant increase in plant diversity in temperate latitudes. However, data from tropical regions remain largely unknown. The record of pollen and spore diversity across the late Paleocene to the early middle Eocene of eight sections in central and eastern Colombia was analyzed. Several techniques, including range-through method, rarefaction, bootstrap, detrended correspondence analysis, and Shannon index, were used to assess the signiﬁcance of the observed diversity pattern. The palynoﬂoral record indicates that the lower to middle Eocene contains a signiﬁcantly higher palynoﬂoral diversity than the underlying upper Paleocene strata. This pattern is maintained after accounting for sample size, number of samples/time unit, lithofacies, and depositional systems. Eocene palynoﬂoras have higher alpha and beta diversities and a higher equitability than Paleocene palynoﬂoras. This increase in diversity is the product of a gradual increase in the rate of ﬁrst appearances and a gradual decrease in the rate of last appearances. The early to middle Eocene increase in diversity, as well as the increase in spore abundance and diversity, suggests that tropical (equatorial) climate became wetter during the early to middle Eocene. This interpretation favors causes for early Eocene warming that do not involve signiﬁcant increases in greenhouse gases. Samples from strata associated with the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum were barren for palynomorphs, and the effects of this climatic event on tropical vegetation remains uncertain.},

	abstract = {Global climate during the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic is thought to have been warmer than at present, but there is debate about winter temperatures. Paleontological data indicate mild temperatures even at high latitudes and in mid-latitude continental interiors, whereas computer simulations of continental paleoclimates produce winter temperatures closer to modern levels. Foliar physiognomy and ﬂoristic composition of 23 Eocene ﬂoras from the interior of North America and Australia indicate cold month means generally {\textgreater}2 ؇C, even where the mean annual temperature (MAT) was {\textless}15 ؇C. Reconstructed Eocene latitudinal gradients of MAT are curvilinear but are about 0.4 ؇C per 1؇ of latitude in continental interiors at mid-latitudes, much less than the 0.8 –1.0 ؇C per 1؇ of latitude observed in eastern and central North America today, but similar to modern gradients in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and on the west coast of North America. Latitudinal temperature gradients reconstructed here are broadly representative of Eocene climates, showing that the discrepancy between proxy data and simulations will not be resolved by regional adjustments to paleogeography or reinterpretation of individual fossil assemblages. Similar discrepancies between proxy data and general circulation model simulations for other time periods suggest that there is a basic ﬂaw with the way climate models simulate heat transport to, or loss from, continental surfaces.},

	abstract = {The Somali jet, a strong low-level cross-equatorial ﬂow concentrated in a narrow longitudinal band near the coast of Somalia, is a key feature of the South Asian monsoon (SAM) circulation. Previous work has emphasized the role of the East African highlands in strengthening and concentrating the jet. However, the fundamental dynamics of the jet remains debated, as does its relation to the SAM precipitation. In this study, numerical experiments with modiﬁed topography over Africa are conducted with the GFDL atmospheric model, version 2.1 (AM2.1), general circulation model (GCM) to examine the inﬂuence of topography on the Somali jet and the SAM precipitation. It is found that when the African topography is removed, the SAM precipitation moderately increases in spite of a weakening of the cross-equatorial Somali jet. The counterintuitive precipitation increase is related to lower-level cyclonic wind anomalies, and associated meridional moisture convergence, which develop over the Arabian Sea in the absence of the African topography. Potential vorticity (PV) budget analyses along particle trajectories show that this cyclonic anomaly primarily arises because, in the absence of the blocking effect by the African topography and with weaker crossequatorial ﬂow, air particles originate from higher latitudes with larger background planetary vorticity and thus larger PV.},

	abstract = {Hydrological dynamics of sedimentary basins are essential for understanding regional climatic pattern in the geological past. In previous qualitative studies lithologically depending on the occurrence of featured sedimentary rocks, the Eocene climate of China had been subdivided into three latitudinal zones, with one subtropical high-controlled arid zone throughout middle China, and two humid zones respectively in the north and south. However, recent advances on mammalian fauna distribution, plant fossil-based quantitative paleoclimatic reconstruction, and modeling experiment jointly suggest that the relatively humid monsoonal climate might have prevailed over the territory. Here we examine and compare sedimentary sequences of 10 Eocene sections across eastern China, and hence the lake level ﬂuctuations, to discuss the nature of climate type. Our results show that, instead of the categorically zonal pattern, the hydroclimate dynamics is intensiﬁed landward. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in contrast to the wide developed coal layers around the periphery, evaporites are growingly occurred endocentrically to the central part of middle China. However, although we have had assumed that all evaporites are indicator of extreme aridity, the highly oscillated climate in the central part of middle China was humid in the majority of the Eocene, distinct from permanent arid as seen in deserts or steppe along modern horse latitude. From the upcountry distribution pattern of the Eocene hydrological dynamics, it appears that the relatively dry climate in central China was caused by the impact of continentality or rain shadow effect under monsoonal, or monsoon-like climate.},

	abstract = {A knowledge of Himalayan erosion history is critical to understanding crustal deformation processes, and the proposed link between the orogen's erosion and changes in both global climate and ocean geochemistry. The most commonly quoted age of India–Asia collision is {\textasciitilde} 50 Ma, yet the record of Paleogene Himalayan erosion is scant — either absent or of low age resolution. We apply biostratigraphic, petrographic, geochemical, isotopic and seismic techniques to Paleogene rocks of the Bengal Basin, Bangladesh, of previously disputed age and provenance. Our data show that the ﬁrst major input of sands into the basin, in the N 1 km thick deltaic Barail Formation, occurred at 38 Ma. Our biostratigraphic and isotopic mineral ages date the Barail Formation as spanning late Eocene to early Miocene and the provenance data are consistent with its derivation from the Himalaya, but inconsistent with Indian cratonic or Burman margin sources. Detrital mineral lag times show that exhumation of the orogen was rapid by 38 Ma. The identiﬁcation of sediments shed from the rapidly exhuming southern ﬂanks of the eastern–central Himalaya at 38 Ma, provides a well dated accessible sediment record 17 Myr older than the previously described 21 Ma sediments, in the foreland basin in Nepal. Discovery of Himalayan detritus in the Bengal Basin from 38 Ma: 1) resolves the puzzling discrepancy between the lack of erosional evidence for Paleogene crustal thickening that is recorded in the hinterland; 2) invalidates those previously proposed evidences of diachronous collision which were based on the tenet that Himalayan-derived sediments were deposited earlier in the west than the east; 3) enables models of Himalayan exhumation (e.g. by mid crustal channel ﬂow) to be revised to reﬂect vigorous erosion and rapid exhumation by 38 Ma, and 4) provides evidence that rapid erosion in the Himalaya was coincident with the marked rise in marine 87Sr/86Sr values since {\textasciitilde} 40 Ma. Whether 38 Ma represents the actual initial onset of vigorous erosion from the southern ﬂanks of the east-central Himalaya, or whether older material was deposited elsewhere, remains an open question.},

The HadGEM2 family of Met Ofﬁce Uniﬁed Model conﬁgurations combines model components which facilitate the representation of many different processes within the climate system, including atmosphere, ocean and sea ice, and Earth System components including the terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycle and tropospheric chemistry. We examine the climatology of the Asian summer monsoon in present-day simulations and in idealised climate change experiments. Members of the HadGEM2 family are used, with a common physical framework (one of which includes tropospheric chemistry and an interactive terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycle), to investigate whether such components affect the way in which the monsoon changes. We focus particularly on the role of interactive vegetation in the simulations from these model conﬁgurations. Using an atmosphere-only HadGEM2 conﬁguration, we investigate how the changes in land cover which result from the interaction between the dynamic vegetation and the model systematic rainfall biases affect the Asian summer monsoon, both in the present-day and in future climate projections. We demonstrate that the response of the dynamic vegetation to biases in regional climate, such as lack of rainfall over tropical dustproducing regions, can affect both the present-day simulation and the response to climate change forcing scenarios.},

To improve understanding of its long-term palaeogeographical evolution, we complement the well-constrained chronological framework of the Tarim Basin in China with stratigraphic records of the sea retreat from the Fergana Basin and the Alai Valley Basin in southern Kyrgyzstan and the Afghan–Tajik Basin in SW Tajikistan. By lithostratigraphic analyses and identiﬁcation of bivalve assemblages, this study establishes for the ﬁrst time a clear and detailed regional correlation of Palaeogene marine strata across Central Asia, showing that the basins share a similar palaeogeographical evolution characterized by a long-term stepwise retreat punctuated by short-term shallow-marine incursions. Our correlation shows that the last two marine incursions recognized in the Tarim Basin can be traced westwards. The permanent disappearance of the sea from Central Asia probably occurred with limited diachroneity in the late Eocene, before the isolation of the Paratethys Sea, shifting the easternmost margin of the sea hundreds of kilometres westwards and probably signiﬁcantly reducing moisture supply to the Asian interior.},

	abstract = {The pattern of the evolutionary radiation of modern birds (Neornithes) has been debated for more than 10 years. However, the early fossil record of birds from the Paleogene, in particular, the Lower Eocene, has only recently begun to be used in a phylogenetic context to address the dynamics of this major vertebrate radiation. The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-P) extinction event dominates our understanding of early modern bird evolution, but climate change throughout the Eocene is known to have also played a major role. The Paleocene and Lower Eocene was a time of avian diversiﬁcation as a result of favourable global climatic conditions. Deteriorations in climate beginning in the Middle Eocene appear to be responsible for the demise of previously widespread avian lineages like Lithornithiformes and Gastornithidae. Other groups, such as Galliformes display replacement of some lineages by others, probably related to adaptations to a drier climate. Finally, the combination of slowly deteriorating climatic conditions from the Middle Eocene onwards, appears to have slowed the evolutionary rate in Europe, as avian faunas did not diﬀerentiate markedly until the Oligocene. Taking biotic factors in tandem with the known Paleogene fossil record of Neornithes has recently begun to illuminate this evolutionary event. Well-preserved fossil taxa are required in combination with ever-improving phylogenetic hypotheses for the interrelationships of modern birds founded on morphological characters. One key avifauna of this age, synthesised for the ﬁrst time herein, is the Lower Eocene Fur Formation of Denmark. The Fur birds represent some of the best preserved (often in three dimensions and with soft tissues) known fossil records for major clades of modern birds. Clear phylogenetic assessment of these fossils will prove critical for future calibration of the neornithine evolutionary timescale. Some early diverging clades were clearly present in the Paleocene as evidenced directly by new fossil material alongside the phylogenetically constrained Lower Eocene taxa. A later Oligocene radiation of clades other than Passeriformes is not supported by available fossil data.},

	abstract = {Until recently American vertebrate paleontologists, particularly students of fossil mammals, have not generally accepted the concept of a former continuous land area around the north end of the Atlantic, connecting western Europe with North America. G. G. Simpson developed biological arguments based on fossil mammals supporting the existence of a corridor (Simpson, 1953 and references cited there) topologically connecting western Europe with North America in the early Eocene, but Simpson was influenced by the stabilistic geologic rationale of the times when he located the, position of the corridor in Asia because of supposed permanence of the Atlantic oceanic barrier during all of Tertiary time. He did not take into account the epicontinental Turgai Straits sea barrier in Asia that lay athwart his corridor in the early Tertiary. The plate tectonic geophysical synthesis of the history of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans is in accord with the mammalian timing evidence that a former Euramerican landmass as well as a biota was severed about 49 m.y. ago and that Holarctic land dispersal since that time has been via Asia alone, becoming possible again with Europe in the midTertiary. Earlier, starting about 70 m.y. ago, a continental collision whose site is now within northeastern Siberia created land continuity between what were then Asia and North America and by the Oligocene the Turgai Straits had finally dried, giving the Holarctic corridor essentially its present configuration. Shallow epicontinental waters have on several occasions crossed Beringia, as at present. Thus the land surface of Holarctica has been rearranged substantially since 70 m.y. ago, North America as a land surface having shifted its allegiance from Europe to Asia.},

	abstract = {The fall into the Oligocene icehouse is marked by a steady decline in global temperature with punctuated cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene transition, both of which are well documented in the marine realm. However, the chronology and mechanisms of cooling on land remain unclear. Here, we use clumped isotope thermometry on northeastern Tibetan continental carbonates to reconstruct a detailed Paleogene surface temperature record for the Asian continental interior, and correlate this to an enhanced pollen data set. Our results show two successive dramatic ({\textgreater}9 °C) temperature drops, at 37 Ma and at 33.5 Ma. These large-magnitude decreases in continental temperatures can only be explained by a combination of both regional cooling and shifts of the rainy season to cooler months, which we interpret to reflect a decline of monsoonal intensity. Our results suggest that the response of Asian surface temperatures and monsoonal rainfall to the steady decline of atmospheric CO2 and global temperature through the late Eocene was nonlinear and occurred in two steps separated by a period of climatic instability. Our results support the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current coeval to the Oligocene isotope event 1 (Oi-1) glaciation at 33.5 Ma, reshaping the distribution of surface heat worldwide; however, the origin of the 37 Ma cooling event remains less clear.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Abstract.\&lt;/strong\&gt; Central Asia experienced a number of significant elevational and climatic changes during the Cenozoic, but much remains to be understood regarding the timing and driving mechanisms of these changes, as well as their influence on ancient ecosystems. Here we describe the palaeoecology and palaeoclimate of a new section from the Nangqian Basin in Tibet, northwestern China, here dated as late Lutetian\&amp;\#8211;Bartonian (late middle\&amp;\#8211;late Eocene) based on our palynological analyses. Located on the east-central part of the Tibetan Plateau, this section is excellently placed for better understanding the palaeoecological history of Tibet following the India-Asia collision. Our new pollen record reveals that a strongly seasonal steppe-desert ecosystem characterised by drought-tolerant shrubs, diverse ferns and an underlying component of broad-leaved forests existed in east-central Tibet during the Eocene, influenced by a southern monsoon. Warming during the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum only prompted a temporary vegetation response, while a drying signature in our pollen record after 40\&amp;\#8201;Ma demonstrates that proto-Paratethys sea retreat caused widespread long-term aridification across the plateau. To better distinguish between local climatic variation and farther-reaching drivers of Central Asian palaeoclimate and elevation, we correlated key palynological sections across the Tibetan Plateau by means of established radioisotopic ages and biostratigraphy. This new palynozonation illustrates both intra- and inter-basinal floral response to plateau uplift and global climate change during the Paleogene, and provides a framework for the age assignment of future palynological studies in Central Asia. Our work highlights the ongoing challenge of integrating various deep time records for the purpose of reconstructing palaeoelevation, indicating that a multiproxy approach is vital for unravelling the complex uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau and its resulting influence on Asian climate.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

This study is focused on the Hungarian Palaeogene Basin within the Central Paratethys, aiming to characterise the eﬀect of the global cooling event in the calcareous nannoplankton assemblages and to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the region. Calcareous nannoplankton biostratigraphy is focused on documenting the NP21 Zone. Hierarchical cluster analysis allowed us to distinguish ﬁve successive assemblages. Thereby deﬁned phases are compared with recently published trends in δ18O values and foraminiferal changes. Taxa with a preference for oligotrophic and warm surface waters dominate the lowest assemblage. The next assemblage contains taxa that indicate oligotrophic conditions but temperate surface water at the onset of the EOT. Nannoplankton abundance drops to a minimum in the third phase, when taxa adapted to cool surface waters gradually became dominant. A gradual rebound of nannoplankton abundance is observed in the fourth phase, possibly reﬂecting regional climate change related to the uplifting Alpine chain. After the end of the EOT, the youngest assemblage includes mostly eurytopic taxa which could tolerate an increased rate of freshwater and terrestrial inﬂux.},

Here, we explore the vegetation-climate interactions in the mid-Cretaceous using a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model with a dynamic vegetation component. We run simulations with 1x, 10x and 16x pre-industrial atmospheric CO2. Results show that forests expand from mid-latitudes to high latitudes as CO2 increases from 1x to 10x and 16x, mainly due to the CO2-induced warming. This expansion of mid-to-high latitude forests are largely supported by the distribution of mid-Cretaceous fossil woods and coal deposits. Globally, the presence of vegetation increases mean annual temperature and precipitation by 0.9 ◦C and 0.11 mm day−1 relative to bare ground. High-latitude warming induced by the presence of vegetation (∼1.9 ◦C) is less than half of that reported in previous studies. The weaker warming here is mainly due to less pronounced albedo feedbacks, and to a less extent, reduced poleward heat transport via weakening of the meridional overturning circulation. Our results suggest that other mechanisms in addition to high atmospheric CO2 and high-latitude vegetation are required to maintain the polar warmth.},

After the Eocene/Oligocene transition, an invasion of arctotertiary ﬂoristic elements took place in the European vegetation. This climatically forced, gradual change from a palaeotropical to an arctotertiary type of vegetation is well reﬂected in the Bulgarian ﬂoras. In the present paper, we analyze 12 palaeoﬂoras covering the time span from the late Eocene to the early Miocene from a palaeoecological and palaeoeclimatic viewpoint.},

	abstract = {The Chuckanut and Manastash formations were deposited in a lowland ﬂuvial environment in western Washington during the Paleocene–Eocene. We provide a thorough paleotemperature analysis using the physiognomic characteristics from the fossil dicotyledonous leaves from these formations using two techniques, Leaf Margin Analysis (LMA) and Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP). This work differs from previous analyses by 1) analyzing more localities and including the assessment of the never-before described Taneum Ridge Body and Manastash Main Body within the Manastash Formation and the Maple Falls Member of the Chuckanut Formation, and 2) using two different techniques to decipher mean annual temperatures through time. In this study, mean annual temperatures (MAT) were determined from 125 distinct morphotypes and are several degrees higher at each locality than previously reported. MAT values derived from LMA ranged from 17.0° to 28.8 °C for the lowermost and 13.4° to 19.5 °C for the uppermost Chuckanut Formation. The Manastash Formation had MATs ranging from 17.1 °C to 29.1 °C. Using CLAMP, paleotemperatures ranged from 15.3° to 19.4 °C for the lowermost and 12.3° to 15.6 °C for the uppermost Chuckanut Formation and 15.8 to 21.3 °C for the Manastash Formation. These data are compared to other Eocene–Paleocene formations in the western US; the Chuckanut and Manastash formations record some of the warmest paleotemperatures in the Paleogene in the western US because of their low-elevation locations. These paleotemperatures may reﬂect the terrestrial signal of paleoclimate optima deﬁned in marine rocks during the Paleocene–Eocene.},

	abstract = {A new mid-latitude terrestrial climate proxy record is presented for southeastern Australia. The Middle Eocene to Middle Miocene palynoﬂoral and δ13C record of the Latrobe Group, Gippsland Basin, details that the climate of southeastern Australia, paleolatitude 60–50°S, supported the growth of highly diverse subtropical to cool-temperate rainforests. These forests are characterized by mesothermal to microthermal ﬂoral elements that are here interpreted as subtropical (Malvacipollis subtilis and Cupanieidites orthoteichus dominated palynoﬂoras), warmtemperate (Beaupreadites elegansiformis and Phyllocladus mawsonii dominated palynoﬂoras) and cool-temperate (Nothofagus spp. and Dacrycarpidites australiensis dominated palynoﬂoras) rainforests. The palynoﬂoral record of the Latrobe Group indicates that mean annual temperatures were between 20 and 24 °C during the Middle Eocene resulting in subtropical rainforests, between 14 and 20 °C for the late Middle Eocene to earliest (i.e. preOi1) Oligocene resulting in warm-temperate rainforests, between 10 and 14 °C for the late Early Oligocene to Early Miocene resulting in cool-temperate rainforests and between 14 and 20 °C in the Middle Miocene, facilitating the resurgence of warm-temperate rainforest ﬂoras. Rainfall was also likely in excess of 1500 mm throughout the Middle Eocene to the Middle Miocene in southeastern Australia. The climatic trends preserved within this mid-latitude terrestrial record relate to global Cenozoic cooling, the exception being the Middle Miocene records, which instead relate to the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. In the mid-latitude Gippsland Basin, cooling appears to have begun in the Middle Eocene. Correlation of our palynoﬂora with records from Antarctica and New Zealand, in addition to benthic δ18O records, reaﬃrms that the Latrobe Group coals provide a long-term, largely authochthonous mid-latitude ﬂoral record that directly relates to global climatic evolution through the Cenozoic. Our new mid-latitude terrestrial record provides critical insight into the validation of Eocene-Oligocene climate models and improves our understanding of mid-latitude terrestrial ecosystem responses to increased carbon dioxide forcing. The correlation between the δ13C values of the Yallourn and Morwell coal seams to benthic δ13C records also highlights that a relationship exists between the terrestrial and marine benthic δ13C record.},

The results show a drop of temperature and an increase in seasonality and precipitation. The changes in temperature and seasonality follow the trend described for the EOT in southern Europe; however, the increase in precipitation is the opposite of what would be expected. This increase might be related to the stratigraphic location of the Sarral Priabonian leaf bed within a dry stage of a precession cycle, whereas the Cervera Rupelian leaf bed would be located within the wet stage of a similar cycle. CLAMP combined with sedimentology, taphonomy and palaeoecology reveals that precession cycles would produce a shift in the habitat of certain plants during the EOT, with the Lauraceae being limited to riparian communities during the Priabonian of Sarral to grow in small laurisilvas during the Rupelian of Cervera.},

However, whether vegetation and ocean feedbacks play a speciﬁc role in the Asian climate response to TP uplift remains unclear. Here we investigate this issue through a set of numerical experiments with the Community Earth System Model. The results indicate that vegetation and ocean feedbacks have important but different effects on the Asian climate change in association with TP uplift, which are intrinsically related to the adjustment of thermal structure. The vegetation feedback leads to excess annual precipitation in East China and South Asia and a weakening of the Asian winter monsoon winds and winter middle‐ and high‐level tropospheric westerly winds from South Asia to the northwestern Paciﬁc. By comparison, the ocean feedback induces a deﬁcit of annual precipitation particularly in most areas of the Bay of Bengal, Malay Peninsula, and the South China Sea, a weakening of the Asian summer and winter monsoon winds, and a strengthening of the winter middle‐ and high‐level tropospheric westerly winds from South Asia to the northwestern Paciﬁc. These results highlight the importance of vegetation and ocean feedbacks and further facilitate a better understanding of the paleoclimatic response to the uplift of the TP.},

	abstract = {Based on ecospectra of 66 published carpofloras we study dynamics and evolution of Turgay vegetation in Western Siberia during the early Oligocene to earliest Miocene. The ecospectra are obtained using a Plant Functional Type (PFT) classification system comprising 26 herbaceous to arboreal PFTs. The carpofloras originate from seven floristic levels covering the time-span from the Rupelian to early Aquitanian. Key elements of these levels are documented based on original collection materials. Although impacted by local edaphic conditions, the ecospectra can be interpreted in terms of changing vegetation. Our data show that warm temperate mesophytic, mixed conifer-broad-leaved deciduous forest assemblages persisted throughout the Oligocene and earliest Miocene in this core area of Turgai type vegetation. This is in line with comparatively stable climate conditions persisting in the studied time-span, showing a minor temperature decline and coeval moderate increase in seasonality and precipitation. Concurrently, the reconstructed ecospectra contradict significant continental drying throughout the Oligocene and earliest Miocene. Spatial variability of the proportions of PFTs within the single floristic horizons primarily reflects local edaphic conditions. High diversities of PFTs characteristic for swamp vegetation are mainly confined to the early Oligocene and have a regional focus. Our results indicate that taxonomical diversity, particularly concerning mesic herbs and deciduous shrubs and trees, increased towards the end of the Oligocene. This increase in biodiversity probably can be attributed to an increase in rainfall and extension of terrestrial habitats after the final retreat of the Paratethys.},

	abstract = {Palynological results from opposite sides of the northernmost Antarctic Peninsula provide insight on terrestrial vegetation and sea-surface conditions immediately before the Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT), through Early Oligocene glacial conditions and the subsequent Late Oligocene interglacial interval. A latest Eocene sample set from the uppermost La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, James Ross (back-arc) Basin, records a low-diversity Nothofagus (southern beech)-dominated vegetation with some podocarp conifers similar to Valdivian-type forest found today in Chile and Argentina. Marine organicwalled phytoplankton include leiospheres and Eocene dinoﬂagellate cysts such as Vozzhennikovia rotunda, V. apertura, Senegalinium asymmetricum and Spinidinium macmurdoense. Immediately before the EOT near the top of the section the decrease in terrestrial palynomorphs, increase in reworked specimens, disappearance of key dinocysts, and overwhelming numbers of sea-ice-indicative leiospheres plus the small dinoﬂagellate cyst Impletosphaeridium signal the onset of glacial conditions in a subpolar climate. Early to Late Oligocene samples from the Polonez Cove and Boy Point formations on King George Island, South Shetland Islands (magmatic arc), yielded an extremely depauperate terrestrial ﬂora, likely resulting in part from poor vegetation cover during the Polonez Glaciation but also because of destruction of vegetation due to continued regional volcanism. The prevalence of sea-ice-indicative leiospheres in the marine palynomorph component is consistent with polar to subpolar conditions during and following the Polonez Glaciation.},

These events were crucial to the formation of the permanent Antarctic ice cap, affecting both regional and global climate change. Our best insight into how life in the high latitudes responded to this climatic shift is provided by the fossil record from Seymour Island, near the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. While extensive collections have been made from the La Meseta and Submeseta formations of this island, few avian taxa other than penguins have been described and mammalian postcranial remains have been scarce. Here, we report new fossils from Seymour Island collected by the Antarctic Peninsula Paleontology Project. These include a mammalian metapodial referred to Xenarthra and avian material including a partial tarsometatarsus referred to Gruiformes (cranes, rails, and allies). Penguin fossils (Sphenisciformes) continue to be most abundant in new collections from these deposits. We report several penguin remains including a large spear-like mandible preserving the symphysis, a nearly complete tarsometatarsus with similarities to the large penguin clade Palaeeudyptes but possibly representing a new species, and two small partial tarsometatarsi belonging to the genus Delphinornis. These findings expand our view of Eocene vertebrate faunas on Antarctica. Specifically, the new remains referred to Gruiformes and Xenarthra provide support for previously proposed, but contentious, earliest occurrence records of these clades on the continent.},

Despite being a very stable piece of land with a deep geological history, South Australia, as an integral part of Australia, has had a highly variable history in terms of its global positioning and its climate, so that even within the past 65 million years (since the catastrophic event that signalled the end of the Cretaceous), the position of South Australia has changed dramatically, from very close to the South Pole, through to its current position in midsouthern latitudes. During that time the climate has changed to such an extent that the vegetation has reduced by declining from highly diverse, very complex, broad-leafed rainforest, through to today’s scleromorphic forests and shrublands and various other forms of desert vegetation. The transition between these extremes has not been a smooth one, and especially in more recent times there has been significant controversy over the impact on the vegetation coincident with the arrival of Homo sapiens and the demise of the remarkable megafauna.},

This suggests that climate was driven by a gradual process rather than a single perturbation. Paleoprecipitation levels stabilized during the Oligocene, coincident with a stabilization in d18O values, possibly indicating a new climatic steady state.},

The Palaeogene was ﬂoristically deﬁned by Palaeotropical elements forming tropical/subtropical rainforests, mangrove swamps, edaphically-mediated laurophyllous forests and leguminous-sclerophyllous communities. During the Miocene, Iberian landscapes were drastically modiﬁed due to geographic and climatic changes (mainly cooling and aridiﬁcation) changes. Open, steppe-like environments developed towards the interior of the peninsula and Arctotertiary elements invaded mountainous and riparian ecosystems, coexisting with or becoming part of evergreen, broadleaved forests of Palaeotropical species. From the Late Miocene onwards these forests suffered changes due to the extinction of taxa, the impact of environmental change on the survivors, and the perturbations caused by the arrival of further Arctotertiary elements. However, several Palaeotropical taxa overcame the environmental and climatic changes of the Miocene and Pliocene to form a part of the modern ﬂora of the Iberian Peninsula. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {There is strong proxy and model evidence of precession- and obliquity-induced changes in the freshwater budget over the Mediterranean Sea and its borderlands, yet explanations for these changes vary greatly. We investigate the separate precession and obliquity forcing of the freshwater budget over the Mediterranean using a high-resolution coupled climate model, EC-Earth. At times of enhanced insolation seasonality, i.e. minimum precession and maximum obliquity, the area was wetter and the Mediterranean Sea surface was less saline. The latter has been attributed to increased runoff from the south as a consequence of a strengthened North African monsoon, as well as to increased precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea itself. Our results show that both mechanisms play a role in changing the freshwater budget. Increased monsoon runoff occurs in summer during times of enhanced insolation seasonality, especially minimum precession, while increased precipitation is important in winter for both precession and obliquity. We relate changes in winter precipitation to changes in the air-sea temperature difference and subsequently, convective precipitation. The freshening in the minimum precession and maximum obliquity experiments has a strong effect on Mediterranean sea surface salinity and mixed layer depth, thereby likely inﬂuencing deep sea circulation and sedimentation at the ocean bottom.},

They ﬁnd that under subsidence and clear sky conditions there is an increase in OLR with respect to SST at a rate of 1.8–2.5 WmϪ2 (ЊC)Ϫ1. In regions of large-scale ascending motions, which is correlated to, but not always collocated with, regions of warm water, there is a large reduction of OLR with respect to SST associated with increase in deep convection. The rate of OLR reduction is found to be a strong function of the large-scale motion ﬁeld. The authors ﬁnd an intrinsic OLR sensitivity to SST of approximately Ϫ4 to Ϫ5 WmϪ2 (ЊC)Ϫ1 in the SST range of 27Њ–28ЊC, under conditions of weak large-scale circulation. Under the inﬂuence of strong ascending motion, the rate can be increased to Ϫ15 to Ϫ20 WmϪ2 (ЊC)Ϫ1 for the same SST range. The above OLR–SST relationships are strongly dependent on geographic locations. On the other hand, deep convection and largescale circulation exhibit a nearly linear relationship that is less dependent on SST and geographic locations.},

Here we test two of the underlying assumptions of paleoclimate data assimilation as applied so far: (1) climate proxies can be modeled as linear, univariate recorders of temperature and (2) structural errors in GCMs can be neglected. To investigate these two points and related uncertainties, we perform a series of synthetic, paleoclimate data assimilation-based reconstructions where ‘‘pseudo’’ proxies are generated with physically based proxy system models (PSMs) for coral d18O, tree ring width, and ice core d18O using two isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation models. For (1), we ﬁnd that linear-univariate models efﬁciently capture the GCM’s climate in ice cores and corals and do not lead to large losses in reconstruction skill. However, this does not hold for tree ring width, especially in regions where the trees’ response is dominated by moisture supply; we quantify how the breakdown of this assumption lowers reconstruction skill for each proxy class. For (2), we ﬁnd that climate model biases can introduce errors that greatly reduce reconstruction skill, with or without perfect proxy system models. We explore possible strategies for mitigating structural modeling errors in GCMs and discuss implications for paleoclimate reanalyses.},

This is a crucial issue not only in the field of paleoclimatology, but also for predicting the future of the Earth's climate, which will be subject to perturbations by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Indeed, if climate changes due to the Sun were large and rapid, this would make it more difficult to extract the anthropogenic effects from precise records of instrumental data over the past century.

However, such observations only provide indirect (proxy) constraints on physical variables. Proxy system models aim to improve the interpretation of such observations and better quantify their inherent uncertainties. However, existing models are currently scattered in the literature, making their integration difﬁcult. Here, we present a comprehensive modeling framework for proxy systems, named PRYSM. For this initial iteration, we focus on water-isotope based climate proxies in ice cores, corals, tree ring cellulose, and speleothem calcite. We review modeling approaches for each proxy class, and pair them with an isotopeenabled climate simulation to illustrate the new scientiﬁc insights that may be gained from this framework. Applications include parameter sensitivity analysis, the quantiﬁcation of archive-speciﬁc processes on the recorded climate signal, and the quantiﬁcation of how chronological uncertainties affect signal detection, demonstrating the utility of PRYSM for a broad array of climate studies.},

Although the relationship between UK37′ and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is robust and well supported by experimental data, there remain outstanding issues regarding the seasonality of production of alkenones and the response of U3K7′ at very warm and cold SSTs. Using a data set of over 1,300 core-top UK37′ measurements, we ﬁnd compelling evidence of seasonal production in the North Atlantic, North Paciﬁc, and Mediterranean Oceans. We also ﬁnd signiﬁcant attenuation of the U3K7′ response to SST at warm temperatures ({\textgreater}24∘C), with the slope reduced by nearly 50\% as U3K7′ approaches unity.

Previous work suggested a low zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the tropical Pacific during the Pliocene, the so-called “permanent El Niño.” Here, we recalculate SSTs using the alkenone proxy and find moderate reductions in both the zonal and meridional SST gradients during the mid-Piacenzian warm period. These reductions are captured by coupled climate model simulations of the Pliocene, especially those that simulate weaker Walker circulation. We also produce a spatial reconstruction of mid-Piacenzian warm period Pacific SSTs that closely resembles both Pliocene and future, low-emissions simulations, a pattern that is, to a first order, diagnostic of weaker Walker circulation. Therefore, Pliocene warmth does not require drastic changes in the climate system—rather, it supports the expectation that the Walker circulation will weaken in the future under higher CO2.},

We present a high-resolution regional climate modeling study of the North American Laramide foreland. Our simulation depicts early Paleogene climate dynamics in western North America with unprecedented detail. Increased horizontal resolution improves matches between modeled temperatures and data in some basins; however, large-scale cold biases found in prior GCM simulations persist. Our study provides insight into the existence of snow and perennial ice in the Laramide highlands and northwestern Cordillera and describes the summer monsoon along the Rocky Mountain front in great detail. Monsoonal precipitation initiates in the southeastern Rockies in May, penetrates north and west as temperatures warm, and peaks at 1 cm/day along the southern and central mountain front; basins farther to the north and west are drier.},

Fossil-leaf paleoaltimetry, one of the few quantitative proxy approaches, uses fossil-leaf traits to quantify differences in temperature or moist enthalpy between coeval coastal and inland sites along latitudes. These environmental differences are converted to elevation differences using their rates of change with elevation (lapse rate). Here, we evaluate the uncertainty associated with this method using the Eocene North American Cordillera as a case study. To do so, we develop a series of paleoclimate simulations for the Early (∼55–49 Ma) and Middle Eocene (49–40 Ma) period using a range of elevation scenarios for the western North American Cordillera.},

	abstract = {The elevation history of the Himalaya-Tibet orogen is central to understanding the evolution and dynamics of both the Indian-Asia collision and the Asian monsoons. The surface elevation history of the region is largely deduced from stable isotope (d18O, dD) paleoaltimetry. This method is based on the observed relationship between the isotopic composition of meteoric waters (d18Op, dDp) and surface elevation, and the assumption that precipitation undergoes Rayleigh distillation 5 under forced ascent. Here we evaluate how elevation-induced climate change influences the d18Op-elevation relationship and whether Rayleigh distillation is the dominant process affecting d18Op. We use an isotope-enabled climate model, ECHAMwiso, to show that the Rayleigh distillation process is only dominant in the monsoonal regions of the Himalayas when the mountains are high. When the orogen is lowered, local surface recycling and convective processes become important as forced ascent is weakened due to weaker Asian monsoons. As a result, the d18Op lapse rate in the Himalayas increases from 10 around −3 ‰/km to above −0.1 ‰/km, having little relationship with elevation. On the Tibetan Plateau, the meridional gradient of d18O decreases from {\textasciitilde}1 ‰/° to {\textasciitilde}0.3 ‰/° with reduced elevation, primarily due to enhanced sub-cloud reevaporation under lower relative humidity. Overall, we report that using d18Op or dDp to deduce surface elevation change in the Himalaya-Tibet region has severe limitations and demonstrate that the processes that control d18Op vary by region and with surface elevation. In sum, we determine that the application of d18O-paleoaltimetry is only appropriate for 7 of the 50 15 sites from which d18O records have been used to infer past elevations.},

	abstract = {Because of the pervasive role of water in the Earth system, the relative abundances of stable isotopologues of water are valuable for understanding atmospheric, oceanic, and biospheric processes, and for interpreting paleoclimate proxy reconstructions. Isotopologues are transported by both large‐scale and turbulent ﬂows, and the ratio of heavy to light isotopologues changes due to fractionation that can accompany condensation and evaporation processes. Correctly predicting the isotopic distributions requires resolving the relationships between large‐scale ocean and atmospheric circulation and smaller‐scale hydrological processes, which can be accomplished within a coupled climate modeling framework. Here we present the water isotope‐enabled version of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (iCESM1), which simulates global variations in water isotopic ratios in the atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice. In a transient Last Millennium simulation covering the 850–2005 period, iCESM1 correctly captures the late‐twentieth‐century structure of δ18O and δD over the global oceans, with more limited accuracy over land. The relationship between salinity and seawater δ18O is also well represented over the observational period, including interbasin variations. We illustrate the utility of coupled, isotope‐enabled simulations using both Last Millennium simulations and freshwater hosing experiments with iCESM1. Closing the isotopic mass balance between all components of the coupled model provides new conﬁdence in the underlying depiction of the water cycle in CESM, while also highlighting areas where the underlying hydrologic balance can be improved. The iCESM1 is poised to be a vital community resource for ongoing model development with both modern and paleoclimate applications.},

This recognition was based on global dinoflagellate cyst events, including mainly Lejeunecysta species represented by cf. Lejeunecysta communis, L. lata, L. pulchra, Lejeunecysta sp. cf. L. granosa, cf. L. globosa, L. beninensis and other Pheolodinium magnificum, P. africanum, Selenopemphix nephroïdes and Cordosphaeridium inodes. They are associated to terrestrial spores and pollen grains such as Magnastriatites howardii, Spirosyncolpites spiralis, Perfotricolpites digitatus, Retitricoporites irregularis, Retimonocolpites irregularis, Pachydermites diederixii, Psilatricolporites operculatus and Punctodiporites harrisii. The palynostratigraphic interpretations are based on a comparison with calibrated dinoflagellate cyst ranges from several reference sections, mainly in the peri-atlantic and incidentally peri-pacific basins. This study showed changes in the relative abundances of different species or groups of morphologically related species. These changes are palaeoenvironmentally controlled, indicating a deposition occurred between the continental nearshore and marginal marine areas under continental influence. The prevalence of peridinioid dinocysts assemblage suggests deposition in a subtropical province whereas terrestrial pollen grains and spores provided by plants of coastal vegetation dominated by pteridophyts and angiosperms evoke mangrove and swamp forests. These new palynological data, notably the presence of Oligocene especially in the Ivorian terrestrial basin north of the so called “faille des lagunes”, specifies and modifies the previous local stratigraphic scale.},

	abstract = {The palynology of the Upper Cretaceous to Neogene non-marine succession in the Melut Basin, southeast Sudan was investigated. The palynomorphs are overwhelmingly of terrestrial origin, but rare brackish water dinoflagellate cysts and scolecodonts were encountered from the Lower Miocene and Oligocene-Miocene. Mangrove pollen, which is common in coeval West African coastal basins, is rare and inconsistent. Examples are Spinizonocolpites (Nypa) from the Campanian-Maastrichtian to Eocene and Rhizophoraceae (Zonocostites ramonae) from the Neogene. Based on the stratigraphic distribution of selected pollen and spores from four exploration wells, eight informal palynozones from the Campanian to the Neogene are proposed. The zones, in stratigraphically ascending order, are as follows: Assemblage Zone I, Campanian (lower Melut Formation); Assemblage Zone II, Campanian-Maastrichtian (middle Melut Formation); Assemblage Zone III, Maastrichtian (upper Melut Formation); Assemblage Zone IV, Paleocene (Yale Formation); Assemblage Zone V, Eocene (upper Yale and Adar formations); Assemblage Zone VI, Oligocene-Early Miocene (Jimidi and lower Miadol formations); Assemblage Zone VII, Early Miocene (uppermost Miadol and lowermost Daga formations); and Assemblage Zone VIII, Late MiocenePliocene (Daga Formation). The ages are based on stratigraphic positions and a series of first downhole appearances of key species such as Foveotricolpites cf. giganteus (Zone I), Auriculiidites reticulatus (Zone II), Ariadnaesporites spinosus (Zone III), Periretisyncolpites giganteus (Zone IV), Retistephanocolpites williamsii (Zone V), Cricotriporites camerounensis (Zone VI), Perfotricolpites digitatus (Zone VII), and Peregrinipollis nigericus (Zone VIII).},

	abstract = {Two palynological assemblages consisting of pteridophyte spores and angiosperm pollen have been recovered from the Kalarakod and Nirkunnam bore-holes, Alleppey district, Kerala. In the Kalarakod palynoflora, 49 genera and 62 species have been recognised. Out of these, 14 genera and 18 species belong to pteridophyte spores and 35 genera and 44 species are referable to angiosperm pollen. Compositoipollenites alleppeyensis, Myricipites singhii, Bacutriporites venkatachalae, Ornatetradites keralaensis and Verrualetes kalarakodensis have been established as new species. In the Nirkunnam assemblage, 9 genera and 14 species of pteridophyte spores and 22 genera and 25 species of angiosperm pollen have been recognised. Qualitative and quantitative dominance of angiosperm pollen is a conspicuous feature of the assemblage. The palynological succession has been divided into three cenozones, namely the Triangulorites bellus Cenozone, the Crassoretitriletes vanraadshooveni Cenozone and the Malvacearumpollis bakonyensis Cenozone. Palynological data indicate a warm and humid climate with high rainfall during the time of deposition. Ecological analysis of the assemblage identifies several palaeo-associations of low-land, freshwater swamp and water edge, sandy beach and back-mangrove vegetation. A brackish water deposition environment is indicated by back-mangrove elements and dinoflagellate cysts. The palynological succession ranges from Eocene to Early Miocene in age.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the first palynomorph and mollusc assemblages from the sediments in three different sections. From east to west, these are the Şevketiye (northern Biga Peninsula), the Tayfur (Gelibolu Peninsula) and the Kuzu harbour (Gökçeada) (parts of the Danişmen Formation) sections in the south and south-western side of the Thrace Basin (north-west Turkey), with the aim of obtaining information about the composition and structure of vegetation and climate during the Oligocene. The stratigraphic interval extends from late Rupelian to Chattian. The Danişmen Formation in the Şevketiye section yielded a palynomorph association with abundant coastal palms (Arecaceae; Lepidocaryoidae), and mangrove pollen (Pelliciera). A similar assemblage from the Kuzu harbour section was also obtained, with minor contributions of mangrove elements Nypa and Acrostichum aureum, Arecaceae type palm, undifferentiated dinoflagellate cysts and microforaminiferal linings. These palynomorph assemblages, combined with the mollusc data, indicate that low-lying coastal environments prevailed. In contrast, the palynomorphs from the Tayfur section represent a non-marine environment lacking mangrove elements, palm trees, dinoflagellate cysts and microforaminiferal linings. The diversity of angiosperm taxa in the Tayfur palynoflora, which form the bulk of the assemblage, indicates terrestrial vegetation. Quantitative palaeoclimate analyses are based on the Coexistence Approach method, and yield over 22 °C at the coast as indicated by mangrove elements and palms in the Şevketiye and Kuzu harbour palynofloras. For the Tayfur palynoflora, mean annual temperature ranged between 16.5 and 21.3 °C. This indicates a climate cooling, corresponding to the transition from Rupelian to Chattian, and resulted in the pollen changes from mangrove bearing coastal deposits to more inland vegetation.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Abstract.\&lt;/strong\&gt; We present results from an ensemble of seven climate models, each of which has carried out simulations of the early Eocene climate optimum (EECO, {\textasciitilde}\&amp;\#8201;50 million years ago). These simulations have been carried out in the framework of DeepMIP (\&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.deepmip.org/\&quot; target =\&quot;\_blank\&quot;\&gt;www.deepmip.org\&lt;/a\&gt;), and as such all models have been configured with identical paleogeographic and vegetation boundary conditions. The results indicate that these non-CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; boundary conditions contribute between 3 and 5\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#176;C to Eocene warmth. Compared to results from previous studies, the DeepMIP simulations show reduced spread of global mean surface temperature response across the ensemble, for a given atmospheric CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; concentration. In a marked departure from the results from previous simulations, at least two of the DeepMIP models (CESM and GFDL) are consistent with proxy indicators of global mean temperature, and atmospheric CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt;, and meridional SST gradients. The best agreement with global SST proxies from these models occurs at CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; concentrations of around 2400\&amp;\#8201;ppmv. At a more regional scale the models lack skill in reproducing the proxy SSTs, in particular in the southwest Pacific, around New Zealand and south Australia, where the modelled anomalies are substantially less than indicated by the proxies. However, in these regions modelled continental surface air temperature anomalies are consistent with surface air temperature proxies, implying an inconsistency between marine and terrestrial temperatures in either the proxies or models in this region. Our aim is that the documentation of the large scale features and model-data comparison presented herein will pave the way to further studies that explore aspects of the model simulations in more detail, for example the ocean circulation, hydrological cycle, and modes of variability; and encourage sensitivity studies to aspects such as paleogeography and aerosols.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {This paper deals with an Oligocene section that is stratigraphically homogeneous from both a lithological and palynological point of view. It has been impossible to subdivide it into discrete units, using either taxon-range analysis or assemblage-zone approach based on the relative abundance of palynomorphs. Furthermore, the common multivariate numerical methods used so far with success in the region (Cluster Analysis, Principal Components Analysis, etc.) gave no useful results in this case. The search for cyclicity using palynocycles and ecologs has been also unsuccessful. Instead of considering the section of low interest, an alternative, high-resolution ecological approach was attempted to extract the information contained in these sediments. Paleoecological trends were deduced from statistical methods commonly used in modern and Quaternary ecology, mainly TWINSPAN and gradient analysis, combined with diversity analysis. As a result, the fine-scale stratigraphic variability of the data could be successfully explained in terms of paleoecological succession taking place in upper delta environments, characterised by a complex mosaic vegetation including morichales, herbaceous fern swamps, and gallery forests. The succession could be reconstructed in detail, and would be of indirect stratigraphic value for highresolution correlation. This is an example of how the search for narrow or biased objectives can hidden significant information. It is more fruitful to have a wider perspective, and to be open to any information that sediments can provide us, without a priori limitations.},

	abstract = {Indian monsoon rainfall is vital for a large share of the world’s population. Both reliably projecting India’s future precipitation and unraveling abrupt cessations of monsoon rainfall found in paleorecords require improved understanding of its stability properties. While details of monsoon circulations and the associated rainfall are complex, full-season failure is dominated by large-scale positive feedbacks within the region. Here we ﬁnd that in a comprehensive climate model, monsoon failure is possible but very rare under pre-industrial conditions, while under future warming it becomes much more frequent. We identify the fundamental intraseasonal feedbacks that are responsible for monsoon failure in the climate model, relate these to observational data, and build a statistically predictive model for such failure. This model provides a simple dynamical explanation for future changes in the frequency distribution of seasonal mean all-Indian rainfall. Forced only by global mean temperature and the strength of the Paciﬁc Walker circulation in spring, it reproduces the trend as well as the multidecadal variability in the mean and skewness of the distribution, as found in the climate model. The approach offers an alternative perspective on large-scale monsoon variability as the result of internal instabilities modulated by pre-seasonal ambient climate conditions.},

	abstract = {A ﬂoral change occurring in northern South America at the Paleocene=Eocene boundary is analysed using palynological data. The sequence studied is an outcrop from the Venezuelan Maracaibo basin, deposited in shallow marine to coastal environments without apparent stratigraphic breaks. Signiﬁcant pollen and spore counts from 237 samples were studied stratigraphically and statistically in order to compare Paleocene and Eocene palaeoﬂoras and palaeoecological trends. The Late Paleocene=Early Eocene transition is the boundary between two ﬂoras which differ both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, the change is not sudden but stepped and gradual. Paleocene taxa seem to be of pantropical distribution, whereas Eocene assemblages are more restricted to the Neotropics. The global warming well documented elsewhere is proposed as the major cause for these changes. Trends in sporomorph diversity in this record appear to track changes in temperature documented in isotopic records from temperate regions. The extinct parent plant of Echitriporites trianguliformis is tentatively proposed to be intolerant to high temperatures, because of its absence during the Early Eocene warm phase. Palaeoecologically, although marsh and back-mangrove swamps dominated both Late Paleocene and Early Eocene assemblages, their taxonomic compositions were different, especially in the inland marsh forests. Mangrove components are scarce or absent through the whole sequence studied, suggesting the absence of these communities during the time-interval analysed. A palaeoecological subdivision into assemblage zones was not possible; instead, a recurrent pattern suggesting palynological cycles was observed. However, palynocycles could not be studied in detail due to the lack of knowledge of botanical afﬁnities for many of the taxa involved and the apparent absence of mangrove assemblages.},

	abstract = {During the late Eocene in the Colombian Subandean basins, one of the most important oil-bearing rocks of the country was deposited: the Mirador Formation. Palaeogeographical models have interpreted a typically ﬂuvial environment for the lower Mirador Formation and marginal to marine environments for its upper layers. The potential of marine inﬂuence in the upper Mirador beds and the overlying lower Carbonera formation as a correlation tool, and the palaeogeographic distribution of the event have not yet been deﬁned. In order to determine the palaeogeography of this probable incursion, 80 wells and four sections were analysed using palynological techniques. The presence of a marine inﬂuence in the sediments was determined by using a Salinity Index (SI) that describes the negative relationship between continental and marine palynomorphs. The marine inﬂuence has been recognized in two areas: the ﬁrst, in the Putumayo basin, and the second, in the Eastern Cordillera and Central Llanos Foothills. In the Putumayo basin the Salinity Index pattern reveals a southern provenance of the marine incursion, ﬂooding the Colombian territory in a South–North trend through the Ecuadorian coast. The marine inﬂuence of the Eastern Cordillera and the Central-Eastern Llanos Foothills is more difﬁcult to explain. We propose a possible corridor through the proto-Lower Magdalena Valley that connected the Caribbean Sea and the Central Llanos Foothills. Palaeogeographic models for the late Eocene of north-western South America should consider this marine incursion and its geographical distribution.},

	abstract = {Palynological evidence currently used to determine the global eustatic cycles of Haq et al. (1987) requires the existence of sediments from both continental and marine environments. The present work is a contribution to sequence analysis using sediments of continental nature. The boundaries of palynological zones help to locate and date sequence boundaries (SB) and maximum flooding surfaces (MFS); the SB is characterized by hiatuses and/or sudden floral changes (type 1 SB) and barren intervals with oxidized kerogen (type 2 SB), while the MFS may have a few brackish or marine water representatives. When marine fossils are absent, only paleovegetational criteria can be used. In this case, multivariate methods are used to find the most reliable pollen associations. Among them, the coastal and the more inshore associations are selected to compute an index that estimates the position of the tidal limit (TLI). The lateral movements of this tidal limit are recorded and correlated with corresponding sea level fluctuations, thus inferring the SB and MFS from paleovegetational data. The application of these methodologies to two wells from the Maracaibo Basin (western Venezuela) allowed determination of Maastrichtian to Eocene 3rd order cycles from the supercycle sets Upper Zuni A and Tejas A, as well as reconstruction of the local paleogeography of the coastal area.},

Stratigraphic positions for and composition of the local faunas are given. Faunas from the Cotter channels and Montgomery bonebed are correlated with the Porvenir local fauna of the Vieja area. The Coffee Cup local fauna is correlated with the Airstrip local fauna ofthe Vieja area. K-Ar dates associated with each of the local faunas extend from 49.7 and 46.9 to 32,2 m.y. The Skyline local fauna lies above a date of 42.7 m.y. and beneath the Cotter channels and Montgomery bonebed. The stratigraphic ranges of98 genera recovered from West Texas are given in chart form and correlations with Southern California and the Northern Interior are made by faunas and K-Ar dates. The appearance ofentelodonts and rhinocerotoids in the Porvenir local fauna suggests that it may be correlative with western European faunas that follow the Grand Coupure.},

In addition to lower vertebrates, the fauna includes an indeterminate sirenian, the anthracothere Bothriogenys, a new species of the hyracoid genus Thyrohyrax, new species of the hystricognathous rodent genera Metaphiomys and Neophiomys, Metaphiomys schaubi, and a new species of the parapithecid primate genus Apidium. The Zallah Incision local fauna from Libya appears to be close in age to Fayum quarries V and G in the Jebel Qatrani Formation of Egypt and the Taqah locality in the Ashawq Formation of Oman. Considered together, these early Oligocene faunas support a modest level of faunal provincialism across the northern part of Afro-Arabia during the early Oligocene.},

The timing of these events is well constrained in North America and Europe, but the Asian record has yet to produce a synthetic section linking environmental change, mammalian fossils, and precise geochronological dates. Here we present the ﬁrst magnetostratigraphic section for the Hsanda Gol Formation, Mongolia, which yields signiﬁcant Oligocene fossils and also marks a pattern of aridiﬁcation that is tightly correlated to the EOB (33.9 Ma), supporting a broader pattern of aridiﬁcation in the central Asian plateau across the EOB. Oligocene faunas of Asia can now be conﬁdently correlated to those of North America, Europe, and Africa. These results suggest that mammalian faunal turnover within Asia occurred slightly later than similar events within Europe, and question the inﬂuence of Asian immigrants on the Grande Coupure faunal turnover.},

Pollen data are the basis for updating the list of flora identified at Creede. Local extinctions in response to lower sum­ mer rainfall abruptly removed many of the exotic woody taxa of eastern North American and Asian affinity. This loss was followed by the appearance of xeric shrubland taxa of the Ponderosa pine-fir woodland and sagebrush flora that characterize the Colorado area today. Tell-tale genera appear and suggest an understory of shrubs such as Artemisia, Elaeagnus, Ribes, Ephedra, Jamesia, and Shepherdia. Poaceae are also present.

In North America, marine-terrestrial environmental change asynchronicity is inferred from a direct comparison between the astronomically tuned marine EOT record and published 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of volcanic tuffs from the White River Group (WRG) sampled at Flagstaff Rim (Wyoming) and Toadstool Geologic Park (Nebraska), which are type sections for the Chadronian and Orellan North American Land Mammal Ages. We present a new age-model for the WRG, underpinned by highprecision 206Pb/238U zircon dates from 15 volcanic tuffs, including six tuffs previously dated using the 40Ar/39Ar technique. Weighted mean zircon 206Pb/238U dates from this study are up to 1.0 Myr younger than published anorthoclase and biotite 40Ar/39Ar data (calibrated relative to Fish Canyon sanidine at 28.201 Ma). Giving consideration to the complexities, strengths, and limitations associated with both the 40Ar/39Ar and 206Pb/238U datasets, our interpretation is that the recalculated 40Ar/39Ar dates are anomalously old, and the 206Pb/238U (zircon) dates more accurately constrain deposition. 206Pb/238U calibrated age–depth models were developed in order to facilitate a robust intercomparison between marine and terrestrial archives of environmental change, and indicate that: (i) early Orellan (terrestrial) cooling recorded at Toadstool Geologic Park was synchronous with the onset of early Oligocene Antarctic glaciation and (ii) the last appearance datums of key Chadronian mammal taxa are diachronous by ca. 0.7 Myr between central Wyoming and NW Nebraska.},

The overwhelming majority of species becoming extinct during this interval were surface-dwelling forms that were ecologically replaced by more cold-tolerant subsurface-dwelling species as the thermal contrast between surface and subsurface ({\textgreater} 400 m) marine pelagic habitats diminished. Within this 14 m.y. interval of widespread ecological reorganization of the planktic foraminiferal faunas, two subintervals stand out as being characterized by brief, but markedly intensified turnover; these are the middle/late Eocene and the early/late Oligocene.

During the Eocene, the rain forests of both Europe and western North America shared numerous genera, both extinct and extant. The great majority of the latter and most of the closest extant relatives of the former now occur in the Indomalayan region. It is thus clear that much of the present Indomalayan flora represents a relict of a once widespread Northern Hemisphere tropical (s.l.) flora, one that has largely (but not entirely) been eliminated from the New World. Among the possible New World survivors of this boreotropical flora are some of the dry Caribbean genera, which could have been derived from lineages of the dry tropical vegetation of the Gulf Coast Eocene; only a handful of present Neotropical lowland rain forest genera appear to be boreotropical relicts.},

	abstract = {Eocene vegetation patterns and continental temperatures are reconstructed from the palaeobotanical record on a global scale. A total of 100 macrofloras and 45 microfloras compiled from published sources is analysed studying diversities of plant functional types and phytosociological types. The spatial patterns obtained from the diversity of plant functional types reflect the distribution of major Eocene ecosystems. As shown by the analysis different forest associations were most important with trees reaching over 50\% of the total diversity in 92\% of the localities. Using a phytosociological classification scheme employing the ecological requirements of the Nearest Living Relatives of fossil taxa the single floras are analysed by multivariate statistical methods. As a result the Eocene sites are allocated to 7 different groups which can be interpreted in terms of Eocene vegetation units. The distribution of these units is shown in palaeogeographical maps. It is shown that in the Eocene, major vegetation units were zonally arranged. Most of the floras located north and south of 15° latitude are classified as extra-tropical. There is evidence for seasonally drier climate conditions in some regions, but no indication for xerophytic vegetation types. The vegetation of the mid-latitudes is characterized by a very high diversity of evergreen angiosperm woods, especially in the Tethyan realm. The high Northern latitudes were covered by temperate deciduous and mixed deciduous vegetation. The reconstructed vegetational patterns are well in accordance with results obtained from the analysis of various proxy data indicating the existence of very warm high latitudes and a shallow latitudinal temperature gradient during the Eocene.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {The increase in species richness from the poles to the tropics, referred to as the latitudinal diversity gradient, is one of the most ubiquitous biodiversity patterns in the natural world. Although understanding how rates of speciation and extinction vary with latitude is central to explaining this pattern, such analyses have been impeded by the difficulty of estimating diversification rates associated with specific geographic locations. Here, we use a powerful phylogenetic approach and a nearly complete phylogeny of mammals to estimate speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates associated with the tropical and temperate biomes. Overall, speciation rates are higher, and extinction rates lower, in the tropics than in temperate regions. The diversity of the eight most species-rich mammalian orders (covering 92\% of all mammals) peaks in the tropics, except that of the Lagomorpha (hares, rabbits, and pikas) reaching a maxima in northern-temperate regions. Latitudinal patterns in diversification rates are strikingly consistent with these diversity patterns, with peaks in species richness associated with low extinction rates (Primates and Lagomorpha), high speciation rates (Diprotodontia, Artiodactyla, and Soricomorpha), or both (Chiroptera and Rodentia). Rates of range expansion were typically higher from the tropics to the temperate regions than in the other direction, supporting the ‘‘out of the tropics’’ hypothesis whereby species originate in the tropics and disperse into higher latitudes. Overall, these results suggest that differences in diversification rates have played a major role in shaping the modern latitudinal diversity gradient in mammals, and illustrate the usefulness of recently developed phylogenetic approaches for understanding this famous yet mysterious pattern.},

	abstract = {A complete circum-Antarctic seaway did not open until both the South Tasman Rise cleared the Oates Land coast of East Antarctica and Drake Passage opened between the southern tip of South America and the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula. Major plate motions based on dated seafloor spreading anomalies and distinct fracture zone lineations constrain the age of the opening of a seaway between the South Tasman Rise and Antarctica as very close to the Eocene{\textasciicircum}Oligocene boundary, with an unrestricted opening deeper than 2000 m dating from V32 Ma. Timing of the opening of Drake Passage is more circumstantial because the exact motions of certain micro-continental fragments are not known. The motion of Africa with respect to South America as well as the motion of East Antarctica with respect to Africa are well constrained for the Cenozoic. These major plate motions are used with the reasonable assumption of no Cenozoic motion of the Antarctic Peninsula with respect to East Antarctica to constrain the location of the Antarctic Peninsula with respect to the southern tip of South America for the critical period of late Eocene to late Oligocene. Uncertainty of motion of the South Georgia and South Orkney microcontinents and other possible continental fragments make an exact time for opening of Drake Passage difficult to ascertain. Even so, the early Oligocene position of the Antarctic Peninsula with respect to South America requires a through-going, deepwater seaway to have been open at Drake Passage prior to 28 Ma, even given the unconstrained motion of various high-standing crustal fragments in the Scotia Sea. With reasonable assumptions concerning motion of the crustal fragments in the western and central Scotia Sea, it is likely that Drake Passage or passage through Powell Basin was open to deep water circulation by V31 þ 2 Ma.},

The experiments contrast two climate simulations: one with all continents at sea level and one with present-day mountains and plateaus. The simulations in the Eurasia sector show that surface uplift (increased elevation) produces marked increases in the intensity of summer and winter monsoons of Asia, with development of wetter climates to the south and east of the Tibetan plateau and drier climates to the north and west of the plateau; there is a general cooling in northern polar latitudes. Comparison of simulations from two different models shows that the magnitude of the simulated changes depends upon how the models calculate the land surface hydrology and the ocean temperature. The simulated changes produced by surface uplift agree in a general way with many geologic indicators of late Cenozoic climate change. The results suggest that surface uplift of mountains and plateaus has contributed significantly to late Cenozoic climate change but that some other mechanism, perhaps decreasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, is needed to explain the full range of observed trends.},

	abstract = {Long-period orbital forcing is a crucial component of the major global climate shifts during the Cenozoic as revealed in marine pelagic records. A complementary regional perspective of climate change can be assessed from internally drained lake basins, which are directly affected by insolation and precipitation balance. The Ebro Basin in northeastern Iberia embraces a 20 Myr long continuous sedimentary record where recurrent expansions and retractions of the central lacustrine system suggest periodic shifts of water balance due to orbital oscillations. In order to test climatic (orbital) forcing a key-piece of the basin, the Los Monegros lacustrine system, has been analyzed in detail. The cyclostratigraphic analysis points to orbital eccentricity as pacemaker of short to long-term lacustrine sequences, and reveals a correlation of maxima of the 100-kyr, 400-kyr and 2.4-Myr eccentricity cycles with periods of lake expansion. A magnetostratigraphy-based chronostratigraphy of the complete continental record allows further assessing long-period orbital forcing at basin scale, a view that challenges alternate scenarios where the stratigraphic architecture in foreland systems is preferably associated to tectonic processes. We conclude that while the location of lacustrine depocenters reacted to the long-term tectonic-driven accommodation changes, shorter wavelenght oscillations of lake environments, still million-year scale, claims for a dominance of orbital forcing. We suggest a decoupling between (tectonic) supply-driven clastic sequences fed from basin margins and (climatic) base level-driven lacustrine sequences in active settings with medium to large sediment transfer systems.},

We analyzed a 7 million years long terrestrial record of Late Oligocene age from the As Pontes Basin in Northern Spain, which demonstrates that minima in the 405-kyr and 2.4-Myr eccentricity cycles play a key role in peat formation. Such nodes exhibit reduced precession amplitudes, thus avoiding extremes in seasons and seasonal contrast for a prolonged period of time. In the As Pontes Basin, this orbital conﬁguration is associated with a decrease in siliciclastic sedimentation and enhanced peat formation. Feedbacks between equilibrium landscapes and ecosystem stability will lead to a deceleration of weathering and erosion rates in catchment areas and to minimum and stable sediment ﬂux along the sediment routing system. Mid-latitude peat burial could contribute to disturb the carbon cycle by removing (atmospheric) carbon at times of minimum eccentricity.},

	abstract = {The transition from the extreme global warmth of the early Eocene ‘greenhouse’ climate to the present glaciated state is one of the most fundamental reorganizations of global climate known in the geologic record. The Middle to Late Eocene interval between 49 and 33 Ma was a globally important transition period from greenhouse to initial icehouse conditions. The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO, {\textasciitilde}40 Ma) was a transient period of global warming that interrupted the secular Cenozoic cooling trend. The Eocene-Oligocene transition (ca. 33.5 Ma) marks the ﬁrst major decline in Cenozoic global temperatures and the initiation of Antarctic glaciation. However, a major challenge comes from recent investigations of plateau uplift processes and resulting environmental changes. The tectonic evolution of the Iranian plateau oﬀers an explanation for global cooling during the Cenozoic, as a result of the gradual closure of the Neotethyan Sea, which led to the disappearance of the Indian Ocean-Mediterranean Sea connection, mountain building, extensional collapse, rifting, and ﬂare-up type volcanism, erosion, and exhumation. Increasing topography by shortening as a result of subduction of the distal Arabian margin beneath the Iranian Plateau and contemporaneous exhumation of a metamorphic core complex between 49 and 33 Myr ago led to aridiﬁcation of Iranian plateau and to the some elevation of the plateau. This rise in elevation is roughly contemporaneous with the emplacement of ﬂare-up-type volcanics in the Urumiyeh-Dokhtar zone and over large portions of Central Iran. Peak volcanism occurred during the transient warming event MECO. New ﬁndings suggest that this global transition is linked to signiﬁcant aridiﬁcation and cooling in southwest Asia, and thus support the idea that global cooling is associated with the EoceneOligocene transition. The good match of tectonic deformation and uplift of the Iranian Plateau with climatic changes is signiﬁcant.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&lt;strong\&gt;Abstract.\&lt;/strong\&gt; The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) from a largely ice-free greenhouse world to an icehouse climate with the first major glaciation of Antarctica was a phase of major climate and environmental change occurring {\textasciitilde}34 million years ago (Ma) and lasting {\textasciitilde}500\&amp;\#8201;kyr. The change is marked by a global shift in deep sea \&amp;\#948;\&lt;sup\&gt;18\&lt;/sup\&gt;O representing a combination of deep-ocean cooling and global ice sheet growth. At the same time, multiple independent proxies for sea surface temperature indicate a surface ocean cooling, and major changes in global fauna and flora record a shift toward more cold-climate adapted species. The major explanations of this transition that have been suggested are a decline in atmospheric CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt;, and changes to ocean gateways, while orbital forcing likely influenced the precise timing of the glaciation. This work reviews and synthesises proxy evidence of paleogeography, temperature, ice sheets, ocean circulation, and CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; change from the marine and terrestrial realms. Furthermore, we quantitatively compare proxy records of change to an ensemble of model simulations of temperature change across the EOT. The model simulations compare three forcing mechanisms across the EOT: CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; decrease, paleogeographic changes, and ice sheet growth. We find that CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; forcing provides by far the best explanation of the combined proxy evidence, and based on our model ensemble, we estimate that a CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; decrease of about 1.6\&amp;\#215; across the EOT (e.g. from 910 to 560 \&amp;\#8201;ppmv) achieves the best fit to the temperature change recorded in the proxies. This model-derived CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; decrease is consistent with proxy estimates of CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; decline at the EOT.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

The new specimen, which possesses the most primitive dental morphology known in the Bachitheriidae family, predates its western European relatives by at least 4.5 myr. The discovery suggests that ruminants dispersed into Europe in a series of east to west waves, preceding and following the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Probably originating from Asia, the oldest ruminant (reported here) migrated into southeastern Europe. During a second wave, comprising the Grand Coupure dispersal event, ruminants moved into western Europe at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A third wave composed by Bachitheriidae and Tragulidae arrived in western Europe, 2 Myr later, in the earliest Oligocene. The origin of this east to west diachronism was probably facilitated by orogenesis that, episodically, allowed dispersal of ruminants from Asia, through southeastern Europe, and into western Europe, in what we herein term the “Bachitherium dispersal event”. However, none of the abundant perissodactyl fauna from southeastern Europe migrated to western Europe during this time, because, like their relatives in central Asia, they did not survive to terminal Eocene cooling and aridity.},

Today, the dynamics (process) responsible for this change are being examined using computer models, especially General Circulation Models (GCM's). Through such work our understanding of the dynamics of the Earth system improves and our ability to predict future trends is enhanced. But, the success of modelling experiments can only be assessed by comparing results with observations (the pattern), which, for palaeoclimate, are drawn exclusively from the geological record. Palaeoclimate interpreted from geological data is invariably based on analogy with the Recent, the validity of which depends on corroboration from multiple lines of evidence.

Here, I compare 490 published proxy records of CO2 spanning the Ordovician to Neogene with records of global cool events to evaluate the strength of CO2-temperature coupling over the Phanerozoic (last 542 my). For periods with suﬃcient CO2 coverage, all cool events are associated with CO2 levels below 1000 ppm. A CO2 threshold of below  500 ppm is suggested for the initiation of widespread, continental glaciations, although this threshold was likely higher during the Paleozoic due to a lower solar luminosity at that time. Also, based on data from the Jurassic and Cretaceous, a CO2 threshold of below  1000 ppm is proposed for the initiation of cool non-glacial conditions. A pervasive, tight correlation between CO2 and temperature is found both at coarse (10 my timescales) and ﬁne resolutions up to the temporal limits of the data set (million-year timescales), indicating that CO2, operating in combination with many other factors such as solar luminosity and paleogeography, has imparted strong control over global temperatures for much of the Phanerozoic.},

	abstract = {Insolation forcing related to the earth’s orbital parameters is known to play an important role in regulating variations of the South Asian monsoon on geological time scales. The influence of insolation forcing on the Indian Ocean and Asian monsoon is studied in this paper by isolating the Northern and Southern Hemispheric insolation changes in several numerical experiments with a coupled ocean–atmosphere model. The focus is on the response of South Asian summer rainfall (monsoon strength) with emphasis on impacts of the local versus remote forcing and possible mechanisms. The model results show that both Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) summer insolation changes affect the Indian Ocean and Asian monsoon as a local forcing (in the same hemisphere), but only the SH changes result in remote (in the other hemisphere) forcing. The NH insolation change has a local and immediate impact on NH summer monsoons from North Africa to South and East Asia, while the SH insolation change has a remote and seasonal-scale delayed effect on the South Asian summer monsoon rainfall. When the SH insolation is increased from December to April, the sea surface temperature (SST) in the southern tropical Indian Ocean remains high from January to July. The increased SST produces more atmospheric precipitable water over the southern tropical Indian Ocean by promoting evaporation from the ocean. The enhanced precipitable water over the southern Indian Ocean is transported northward to the South Asian monsoon region by the lower-tropospheric mean cross-equatorial flows with the onset of the Asian monsoon increasing precipitable water over South Asia, eventually leading to the increase of Indian summer monsoon precipitation. Thus, these model experiments, while idealized and not fully representing actual orbitally forced insolation changes, confirm the broadscale response of northern monsoons to NH summer insolation increases and also illustrate how SH summer insolation increases can have a delayed influence on the Indian summer monsoon.},

Early Eocene hiatuses do not match ␦18O changes, and it is unlikely that they are the result of glacioeustasy, consistent with an ice-free early Eocene. Early-middle Eocene (49 – 43 Ma) evidence for a link between sequences and ␦18O is equivocal, and the presence of large ice sheets is uncertain. Beginning in the late-middle Eocene (43– 42 Ma), concomitant increases in planktonic and benthic ␦18O records coincide with the timing of hiatuses on the New Jersey coastal plain and a change from carbonate-dominated to siliciclastic-dominated sedimentation. These represent the development of the Antarctic ice cap and the beginning of the “icehouse” world. Of the 14 sequences predicted by Haq et al. for this interval, 9 are resolvable on the New Jersey margin, and the other 5 appear to be combined with others. We conclude that although ice-volume changes controlled sequences since at least 42 Ma, mechanisms for sea-level change prior to then are still not fully understood.},

	abstract = {Paleogene temporal and paleogeographic constraints on mammalian faunal interchange between Africa and Eurasia are reassessed in order to discuss the origin of Primates, Anthropoidea, and Catarrhini. During the late Paleocene to early Eocene interval, the fossil record indicates faunal exchange between Africa and the North Tethyan areas involving several groups of mammals, such as the earliest primates, carnivores, and some archaic ungulates. The polarities of such dispersal events are unresolved to date. Regarding the paleogeography of anthropoid origins, previous cladistic assessments argued for a dispersal from Asia to Africa during the early Eocene. However, faunal exchange during that period has been documented only between Africa and Europe. A speculative basis for an Asian origin of African zegdoumyid rodents is the only body of evidence that suggests that the earliest anthropoids might have migrated to Africa from Asia. Finally, according to the putative occurrence of catarrhines (amphipithecids) in the middle Eocene of Asia, a middle Eocene migration event towards Africa is proposed, although this is supported only by hystricognath and anomaluroid rodents, and by anthracotheriid artiodactyls. In conclusion, the early paleobiogeographic history of anthropoids remains conjectural because of the lack of phylogenetic resolution.},

	abstract = {The Indo‐Asian Monsoon (IAM) has changed as the topographies of Asia were assembled into their current conﬁguration. Understanding complex interactions between topography and the IAM through time has been hampered, in part, by poorly resolved topography and atmospheric dynamics in climate models. Here, we employ high‐resolution (0.23° × 0.31°) global climate simulations, to more accurately capture these interactions. We ﬁnd that the Himalayas and Tibet primarily redirect the onshore moisture transport and produce local orographic precipitation. The Iranian Plateau is the primary gatekeeper, insulating the pool of high‐enthalpy air in the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP) from westerly low‐enthalpy advection. But, even when such high‐enthalpy air exists along the IGP, vigorous precipitation in the region (poleward of 25°N) still requires orographic steering and lifting. The large‐scale circulations—largely governed by sea surface temperature gradients—robustly advect water vapor onshore regardless of topography. Thus, neither topography nor localized enthalpy air drives onshore monsoon ﬂow. Plain Language Summary The Indo‐Asian Monsoon (IAM) circulation is an exemplar for how tectonic processes interact with regional climate systems. However, topography‐atmosphere interaction is complex, challenging to model, and understanding the IAM at a speciﬁc period in Earth's history involves the consideration of multiple topographically induced circulations. To better capture such processes, we simulate the global climate using high‐resolution ({\textasciitilde}25 km) simulations with alternative Asian topographic boundary conditions. Here, we determine the individual importance of the Himalayas, Tibetan, and Iranian Plateaus. Instead of the previously proposed heating or insulating mechanisms, we ﬁnd that the primary role of topography is to redirect and lift the onshore monsoon air to produce orographic precipitation. We show that onshore ﬂows exist regardless of topography and are governed by sea surface temperature gradients. Thus, neither topography nor localized enthalpy air drives onshore monsoon ﬂow. Our ﬁndings have implications for tropical monsoon theories and the paleoclimatology of Asia.},

	abstract = {The Sun is powered by a very stable source of fusion energy in its core that radiates that energy outward in a constant ﬂow. Yet it has a cycle of magnetic dynamo activity whose strength and duration are variable. This variability, which affects the Earth's “space climate,” points to temporal changes in the convective and diffusive transport of magnetic ﬂux above the tachocline, where the ﬂux is generated. The longest record we have of this variability is the time series of sunspot numbers. This record suggests that the interior of the Sun follows a clock‐like magnetic ﬂux production cycle with a length of close to 11.05 years. The variations in sunspot cycle duration, as well as the sunspot number rise and fall times, their hemispheric asymmetries, and the maximum sunspot numbers of the individual cycles are likely produced in the process of the magnetic ﬂux transport. Helioseismology continues to shed more light on the convection zone variabilities, including the “torsional oscillations” that seem to have a special connection to the emerging strong magnetic ﬂuxes that produce the sunspots. These new observations may eventually lead to an explanation for the surprisingly good correlation between the rate of sunspot appearance and the maximum sunspot number and to a better understanding of the relationship between the solar dynamo and the sunspot number cycle. Better understanding of the polar regions awaits long‐term monitoring with a polar solar mission. Better predictions of near‐term space weather could be obtained from a permanent L5 monitor. Plain Language Summary The Sun is a giant rotating ball of electrically conducting material that has existed for approximately 4.5 billion years, burning hydrogen, turning it into helium, and producing energy that radiates upward toward the Sun's surface. This process is steady deep inside the Sun, but the surface of the Sun is far from steady. At about 70\% of its radius, the transfer of the nuclear heat becomes more efﬁcient if it is transferred by convection and overturning rather than radiation. The rising, spinning, electrically conducting liquid in the outer solar layer produces a magnetic ﬁeld that reverses every sunspot number cycle. These cycles vary in length from about 9 to 13.6 years but average close to 11 years. The sunspot numbers in the southern and northern hemispheres are somewhat independent and peak at different times with different amplitudes. The variations are consistent with the diffusion of magnetic ﬁelds in a nonideal conductor. The sunspot numbers appear to have long‐term cyclic behavior. The durations of these grand cycles are difﬁcult to predict. The Sun seems to be a dependable power source, but predicting the strength and timing of its cycles is difﬁcult.},

Contrary to expectations, the simulated monsoonal Hadley circulation is weaker when perihelion occurs at the summer solstice than when aphelion occurs at the summer solstice. The angular momentum balance and energy balance are examined to understand the mechanisms that produce this result. That the summer with stronger insolation has a weaker circulation is the result of an increase in the atmosphere’s energetic stratiﬁcation, the gross moist stability, which increases more than the amount required to balance the change in atmospheric energy ﬂux divergence necessitated by the change in top-of-atmosphere net radiation. The solstice-season changes result in annual-mean Hadley circulation changes (e.g., changes in circulation strength).},

One approach to address the issue is to study the geologic record, which may provide clues about what the future holds for ocean chemistry and marine organisms. This article reviews basic controls on ocean carbonate chemistry on different timescales and examines past ocean chemistry changes and ocean acidiﬁcation events during various geologic eras. The results allow evaluation of the current anthropogenic perturbation in the context of Earth’s history.

	abstract = {Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide have been proposed as a major regulator of climate during the last 570 million years. Continental weathering and its variation over time are hypothesized to be important for controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide. Continental weathering is altered by changes in total runoff as well as changes in the size and elevation of the land masses to be weathered. When paleogeographic information for the Phanerozoic (570 m.y. ago to present) is used in a global climate model, the model exhibits substantial variations in precipitation, evaporation, and runoff. Even with dramatically different land-ocean distributions, an increase in global surface temperature leads to an increase in global precipitation but not always an increase in global runoff. During the early Phanerozoic (514-342 Ma), when the continents are relatively small and widely distributed, runoff depends on continental evaporation and temperature. As the continents migrate into subtropical latitudes, global runoff decreases as global land temperatures and evaporation increase. As the continents shift to higher latitudes, global runoff increases as global land temperatures and evaporation decrease. During the middle to late Phanerozoic (306 Ma-present), when large continental land masses predominate, runoff depends on continental precipitation. Experiments with increased atmospheric CO2 for the middle Ordovician (458 Ma), when the paleocontinent of Gondwana was centered at subtropical latitudes, and the early Silurian (425 Ma), when Gondwana had shifted to middle and high latitudes, also point to a correlation between land mass location and runoff. Global runoff increases 15\% with increased CO2 at 425 Ma but remains unchanged for 458 Ma, even though global mean temperature and precipitation increase comparable amounts for the two time periods. These results imply that weathering feedback between temperature and runoff may be dependent on landocean configuration.},

An abrupt warming of oceanic intermediate waters could have initiated the thermal destabilization of sediment-hosted methane gas hydrates and potentially triggered sediment slumps and slides. In an ensemble of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) simulations of the late Paleocene and early Eocene, we identify such a circulation-driven enhanced intermediate-water warming. Critically, we ﬁnd an approximate twofold ampliﬁcation of Atlantic intermediate-water warming when CO2 levels are doubled from 2× to 4× preindustrial CO2 compared to when they are doubled from 1× to 2×. This warming is largely focused on the equatorial and South Atlantic and is driven by a signiﬁcant reduction in deep-water formation from the Southern Ocean. This scenario is consistent with altered PETM circulation patterns inferred from benthic carbon isotope data and the intensity of deep-sea carbonate dissolution in the South Atlantic. The linkage between intermediate-water warming and gas hydrate destabilization could provide an important feedback in the establishment of peak PETM warmth.},

The time scale of this silicate weathering negative feedback on atmospheric pCO2 will determine the duration of perturbations to the carbon cycle, be they geological release events or the current anthropogenic perturbation. However, there has been little previous work on quantifying the time scale of the silicate weathering feedback, with the primary estimate of 300–400 kyr being traceable to an early box model study by Sundquist (1991). Here we employ a representation of terrestrial rock weathering in conjunction with the “GENIE” (Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system) model to elucidate the diﬀerent time scales of atmospheric CO2 regulation while including the main climate feedbacks on CO2 uptake by the ocean. In this coupled model, the main dependencies of weathering—runoﬀ, temperature, and biological productivity—were driven from an energy-moisture balance atmosphere model and parameterized plant productivity. Long-term projections (1 Myr) were conducted for idealized scenarios of 1000 and 5000 PgC fossil fuel emissions and their sensitivity to diﬀerent model parameters was tested. By ﬁtting model output to a series of exponentials we determined the e-folding time scale for atmospheric CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering to be ∼240 kyr (range 170–380 kyr), signiﬁcantly less than existing quantiﬁcations. Although the time scales for reequilibration of global surface temperature and surface ocean pH are similar to that for CO2, a much greater proportion of the peak temperature anomaly persists on this longest time scale; ∼21\% compared to ∼10\% for CO2.},

	abstract = {The motion of Arabia was stable with respect to Eurasia over the past 22 Ma. Deformation and exhumation in the Zagros is seen to initiate at the same time as argued by new detrital thermochronologic constraints and increasing accumulation rates in synorogenic sediments. A recent magnetostratigraphic dating of the Bakhtyari conglomerates in the northern Fars region of the Zagros further suggests that shortening and uplift in the Zagros Folded Belt accelerated after 12.4 Ma. Available temporal constraints from surrounding collision belts indicate that shortening and uplift focused in regions bordering the Iranian plateau to the south between 15 and 5 Ma. As boundary velocity was kept constant this requires concomitant decreasing strain rates in the Iranian plateau. Slab detachment has been proposed to explain the observed changes as well as mantle delamination, but the insigniﬁcant change in the Arabian slab motion and lack of unambiguous constraints make both hypotheses difﬁcult to account for. It is proposed based on a review of shortening estimates provided throughout the Arabia–Eurasia collision that the total 440 km of convergence predicted by geodesy and plate reconstruction over the past 22 Ma can be accounted for by distributed shortening. I suggest that the topography and expansion of the Iranian plateau over Late Miocene–Pliocene time can be reproduced by the progressive thickening of the originally thin Iranian continental lithosphere presumably thermally weakened during the Eocene extensional and magmatic event.},

	abstract = {The thermal effect of the Tibetan–Iranian Plateau (TIP) on the Asian summer monsoon and the role of air–sea interactions over the Indian Ocean in regulating the effects of the TIP are explored. The results demonstrate that the direct thermal effect of the TIP produces a lower troposphere cyclonic circulation in the area surrounding the TIP and increases the continental precipitation over South and East Asia. It also decreases the precipitation over the tropical Indian Ocean and increases the sea-surface temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean with a large gradient zone located along 10°N but decreases SST of the western coast of Indonesia. In the lower troposphere, the air–sea interaction induced by the TIP thermal forcing produces an anticyclonic circulation surrounding the TIP and a stronger westerly flow to the south of the anticyclone. A circulation dipole thus forms to the south of the TIP. Together with this horizontal dipole, a meridional circulation dipole is generated to the south of the TIP, which is characterized by strong air ascent from 10 to 15°N where a strong westerly flow occurs, and the descent of air over the southern slope of the TIP and south Hemisphere. These results demonstrate that the indirect effect of the air–sea interaction over the Indian Ocean induced by the TIP thermal forcing is to counteract its direct effect on the Asian summer monsoon. The uncertainty of this indirect effect is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Changes in atmospheric pCO2 are widely suggested to have played a major role in both the long-term deterioration of Cenozoic climate and many superimposed rapid climate perturbations such as the pivotal Eocene-Oligocene transition. Changes in marine productivity affecting the biological oceanic carbon pump represent one possible cause of past CO2 variability. Here we explore the relationship between ocean gateway change and marine biogeochemistry. Speciﬁcally, we use a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-biogeochemical model (IPSL-CM5A) to examine global ocean paleoproductivity changes in response to the opening of Drake Passage. In our simulations, we ﬁnd that Drake Passage opening yields a spatially uniform decrease in primary productivity in the low-latitude oceans while the high-latitude response is more spatially heterogeneous. Mechanistically, the low-latitude productivity decrease is a consequence of a fundamental reorganization of ocean circulation when Drake Passage opens driven by the isolation of the Southern Ocean from low-latitude water masses. Nutrient depletion in the low latitudes is driven by a marked decrease in the intensity of deep convection in the Southern Ocean, which drives the accumulation of nutrients at depth and their depletion in the intermediate and upper ocean, especially away from sites of subduction. In the high latitudes, the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the model exerts a strong control both on nutrient availability and on regions of deep-water formation. The qualitative agreement between geographically diverse long-term paleoproductivity records and the simulated variations suggests that Drake Passage opening may contribute to the long-term paleoproductivity signal.},

Teeth of large terrestrial ungulates are reliable proxies to trace long-term climatic changes due to their morphological and physicochemical properties; however, the role of premolar molarization in ungulate evolution and related climatic change has rarely been investigated. Recently, three patterns of premolar molarization among perissodactyls have been recognized: endoprotocrista-derived hypocone (type I); paraconule–protocone separation (type II); and metaconule-derived pseudohypocone (type III). These three patterns of premolar molarization play an important role in perissodactyl diversity coupled with global climate change during the Cenozoic in Asia. Those groups with a relatively higher degree of premolar molarization, initiated by the formation of the hypocone, survived into Neogene, whereas those with a lesser degree of molarization, initiated by the deformation of existing ridges and cusps, went extinct by the end of the Oligocene. In addition, the hypothesis of the “Ulan Gochu Decline” is proposed here to designate the most conspicuous decrease of perissodactyl diversity that occurred in the latest middle Eocene rather than at the Eocene–Oligocene transition in Asia, as conventionally thought; this event was likely comparable to the contemporaneous post-Uintan decline of the North American land fauna.},

Allowing for time heterogeneity in speciation rate estimates for over 60,000 angiosperm species, we found that the LDG does not arise from variation in speciation rates because lineages do not speciate faster in the tropics. These results were consistently retrieved using two other methods to test the association between occupancy of tropical habitats and speciation rates. Our speciation rate estimates were robust to the effects of both undescribed species and missing taxa. Overall, our results show that speciation rates follow an opposite pattern to global variation in species richness. Greater ecological opportunity in the temperate zones, stemming from less saturated communities, higher species turnover or greater environmental change, may ultimately explain these results.},

From this characterization of the surface anisotropy, the algorithm performs angular integrations to derive intrinsic land surface albedos for each spectral band and three broad bands covering the solar spectrum. The albedo measures are a directional hemispherical re ectance  black sky albedo  obtained by integrating the BRDF over the exitance hemisphere for a single irradiance direction, and a bihemispherical re ectance  white sky albedo  obtained by integrating the BRDF over all viewing and irradiance directions. Because these albedo measures are purely properties of the surface and do not depend on the state of the atmosphere, they can be used with any atmospheric speci cation to provide true surface albedo as an input to regional and global climate models. The at-launch algorithm makes use of a linear kernel-based model the semiempirical reciprocal RossThick-LiSparse model. Validation of the BRDF model and its performance under conditions of sparse angular sampling and noisy re ectances shows that the retrievals obtained are generally reliable. The solar-zenith angle dependence of albedo may be parameterized by a simple polynomial that makes it unnecessary for the user to be familiar with the underlying BRDF model. Spectral-to-broadband conversion is achieved using banddependent weighting factors. The intrinsic land surface albedos may be used to derive actual albedo by taking into account the prevailing distribution of di use skylight.},

Methodologies relying on autecology of the nearest living relatives may thus produce biased and possibly unrealistic proxies.

	abstract = {Holarctic biodiversity has been influenced by climatic fluctuations since the Pliocene. Asia Minor was one of the major corridors for postglacial invasions in the Palearctic. Today this area is characterized by an extraordinarily rich fauna with close affiliation to European, Asian and Indo-African biota. However, exact scenarios of range expansion and contraction are lacking. Using a phylogeographical approach we (i) identify monophyletic lineages among Anatolian mountain frogs and (ii) derive a spatio-temporal hypothesis for the invasion process in Anatolia. We sequenced 540 bp of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene from 40 populations of mountain frogs from Anatolia, the Elburz Mountains and the Caucasus. Our samples comprise all known species and subspecies: Rana macrocnemis macrocnemis, R. m. tavasensis, R. m. pseudodalmatina, R. camerani and R. holtzi. They include the type localities of four of these taxa. We used a nested clade analysis (NCA) to infer historical and recurrent events that account for the observed geographical distribution of haplotypes. None of the extant species is monophyletic. Based on a molecular clock calibration using homologous sequences of Western Palearctic water frogs of the same genus, we estimated that a basic radiation into three lineages c. 2 Mya was followed by several dispersal and fragmentation events. The geographical distribution of resident and widespread haplotypes allows us to infer and date scenarios of range expansion and fragmentation that are aligned with dramatic climatic oscillations that have occurred during the last 600 000 years. Consequently, Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic oscillations triggered the evolution of Anatolian mountain frogs through an interplay of vicariance and dispersal events.},

	abstract = {Island biotas have disproportionately influenced the history and development of evolutionary biology, but understanding their genesis and evolution across geological timescales has been hindered by a poor fossil record. Here we augment the insular Eocene ({\textasciitilde}43 Ma) mammalian fauna known from the Pontide terrane of central Anatolia by describing two new metatherian taxa (stem marsupials) from the Lu¨ lu¨ k Member of the Uzunc¸arşıdere Formation in the Orhaniye Basin. Geological and paleontological data indicate that the Pontide terrane was an island on the northern margin of Neotethys during the middle Eocene. Reflecting its geodynamic context in a region of active tectonic convergence, the Eocene Pontide terrane hosted a unique combination of Laurasian and Gondwanan mammals, including an anachronistic radiation of pleuraspidotheriids (archaic ungulates) that went extinct on the European mainland {\textasciitilde}13 Ma earlier. Most of the mammalian clades occupying the Pontide terrane colonized it by dispersal across marine barriers rather than being stranded there through vicariance. Endemic radiations of pleuraspidotheriid ungulates and polydolopimorphian metatherians on the Pontide terrane reveal that in situ diversification was an important factor contributing to faunal assembly and evolution. The insular fauna that arose on the Pontide terrane is highly analogous to that of modern Sulawesi, which evolved under strikingly similar geological conditions. Illustrating the ephemeral nature of insular biotas across macroevolutionary timescales, the demise of the Pontide fauna coincided with paleogeographic changes enabling more cosmopolitan taxa to reach it for the first time. The high level of endemism shown by the mammalian fauna of the Uzunc¸arşıdere Formation eliminates the Pontide terrane as a potential early Eocene dispersal corridor between western Europe and India.},

The new taxon most closely resembles the palaeochiropterygids Lapichiropteryx and Stehlinia in terms of its known dental morphology, and it is referred to the stem chiropteran family Palaeochiropterygidae on this basis. Geological and palaeontological data indicate that the Pontide terrane was an island situated along the northern margin of Neotethys during the middle Eocene. The presence of a late-surviving stem chiropteran in an island context potentially illuminates dispersal patterns and capabilities among the earliest bats, which already enjoyed a nearly global distribution by the early Eocene. Other palaeochiropterygids for which postcranial material is known share little in common with extant bats that are capable of long-range dispersal across open water. The new Turkish bat taxon is consistent with a hypothetical dispersal corridor between Western Europe and India via islands on the northern margin of Neotethys and suggests a larger range of skeletal and locomotor variation within Palaeochiropterygidae than is currently recognised.},

	abstract = {Early Eocene global climate was warmer than much of the Cenozoic and was punctuated by a series of transient warming events or ‘hyperthermals’ associated with carbon isotope excursions when temperature increased by 4–8° C. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, {\textasciitilde}55 Ma) and Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2, 53.5 Ma) hyperthermals were of short duration ({\textless} 200 kyr) and dramatically restructured terrestrial vegetation and mammalian faunas at midlatitudes. Data on the character and magnitude of change in terrestrial vegetation and climate during and after the PETM and ETM2 at high northern latitudes, however, are limited to a small number of stratigraphically restricted records. The Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) marine sediment core from the Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Basin provides a stratigraphically expanded early Eocene record of Arctic terrestrial vegetation and climates. Using pollen/spore assemblages, palynofacies data, bioclimatic analyses (Nearest Living Relative, or NLR), and lipid biomarker paleothermometry, we present evidence for expansion of mesothermal (Mean Annual Temperatures 13–20˚C) forests to the Arctic during the PETM and ETM2. Our data indicate that PETM mean annual temperatures were {\textasciitilde}2˚ to 3.5˚C warmer than those of the Late Paleocene. Mean winter temperatures in the PETM reached ≥5°C ({\textasciitilde}2˚C warmer than the late Paleocene), based on pollen-based bioclimatic reconstructions and the presence of palm and Bombacoideae pollen. Increased runoff of water and nutrients to the ocean during both hyperthermals resulted in greater salinity stratification and hypoxia/anoxia, based on marked increases in concentration of massive Amorphous Organic Matter (AOM) and dominance of low-salinity dinocysts. During the PETM recovery, taxodioid Cupressaceae-dominated swamp forests were important elements of the landscape, representing intermediate climate conditions between the early Eocene hyperthermals and background conditions of the late Paleocene.},

Whether this was caused by climate change or by competition with taxa dispersing from Asia is controversial. The mammalian faunas in this record, after rarefaction analysis, show a sharp reduction in diversity only after the Grande Coupure. Improved correlation of NW European successions to global events conﬁrms the Grande Coupure as earliest Oligocene. It shows that a c. 350 ka hiatus interrupts the Hampshire and Paris Basin sequences prior to the ﬁrst record of post-Grande Coupure Asian taxa. Hiatusbridging faunas from elsewhere in Europe record mainly post-Grande Coupure taxa, suggesting that the turnover occurred early in the hiatus, minimizing bias to the turnover pattern. A previously unrecorded, second, smaller turnover, involving European mammals only, immediately precedes the Grande Coupure in the Hampshire Basin, coinciding with vegetational change. This turnover is judged not to represent cooling. It is concluded that the Grande Coupure coincides with the earliest Oligocene Oi-1 glaciation and that climate change combined with competition to produce the turnover.},

During this event, a large number of European Eocene endemic mammals became extinct and new Asian immigrants appeared. The absolute age of the Grande Coupure, however, has remained controversial for decades. The Late Eocene–Oligocene continental record of the Eastern Ebro Basin (NE Spain) constitutes a unique opportunity to build a robust magnetostratigraphybased chronostratigraphy which can contribute with independent age constraints for this important turnover. This study presents new magnetostratigraphic data of a 495-m-thick section (Moià-Santpedor) that ranges from 36.1 Ma to 33.3 Ma. The integration of the new results with previous litho- bio- and magnetostratigraphic records of the Ebro Basin yields accurate ages for the immediately pre- and postGrand Coupure mammal fossil assemblages found in the study area, bracketing the Grande Coupure to an age embracing the Eocene–Oligocene transition, with a maximum allowable lag of 0.5 Myr with respect to this boundary. The shift to drier conditions that accompanied the global cooling at the Eocene–Oligocene transition probably determined the sedimentary trends in the Eastern Ebro Basin. The occurrence and expansion of an amalgamated-channel sandstone unit is interpreted as the forced response of the ﬂuvial fan system to the transient retraction of the central-basin lake systems. The new results from the Ebro Basin allow us to revisit correlations for the controversial Eocene–Oligocene record of the Hampshire Basin (Isle of Wight, UK), and their implications for the calibration of the Mammal Palaeogene reference levels MP18 to MP21.},

Multiple lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these changes signal major global cooling, especially at high latitudes, and rapid growth of semipermanent ice-sheet on Antarctica in the early Oligocene. The quality and temporal resolution of Eocene–Oligocene fossil and sediment records and the diversity of climatic proxy tools have increased enormously in recent years, bringing a new level of detail to the study of this transition. The higher-resolution records have revealed that the climatic shifts across the Eocene– Oligocene boundary occurred in multiple stages that can be calibrated on orbital timescales. Coupled with incresasingly sophisticated computer models, these records have led to signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of possible causal mechanisms and feedbacks driving this global shift. Here we review the wealth of evidence for Eocene–Oligocene climate change, summarize the current state of understanding, and highlight the key areas still requiring work that might guide the direction of future research. Obtaining a thorough understanding of this critical climatic transition is important for highlighting the mechanisms and sensitivities of Cenozoic climate, and addressing topical questions relating to the dynamics of global change during greenhouse–icehouse climate switching.},

	abstract = {We present the ﬁndings from analysis and modeling of a stratigraphic series of magnetic susceptibility (MS) data measured with a portable MS meter from the Permian Salagou Formation loessite (south-central France). The results reveal discernible Milankovitch-scale paleoclimatic variability throughout the Salagou Formation, recording astronomically forced climate change in deep-time loessite of eastern equatorial Pangea. Optimal sedimentation rates are estimated to have ranged between 9.4 cm/kyr (lower Salagou Formation) and 13 cm/kyr (mid-upper Salagou Formation). A persistent 10-m-thick cyclicity is present that likely represents orbital eccentricity-scale (∼100 kyr) variability through the middle to late Cisuralian (ca. 285—275 Ma). Subordinate, higher frequency cycles with thicknesses of ∼3.3–3.5 and ∼1.8 m appear to represent obliquity and precession-scale variability. If the driver of magnetic enhancement is pedogenic, then the ∼10 m thick cyclicity that is consistent over ∼1000 m of section may represent the thickness of loessite–paleosol couplets in the Salagou Formation. Laboratory rock magnetic data show generally low magnetic enhancement compared to analogous Eurasian Quaternary loess deposits. This is related to the predominance of hematite (substantially weaker signal than magnetite or maghemite) in the Salagou Formation which may be explained by different conditions of formation (e.g., syn depositional processes, more arid, and/or oxidizing climate conditions) than in present Eurasia and/or post depositional oxidation of magnetite and maghemite.},

One is the highly nonlinear dependence on latitude of the ‘‘force’’ acting on the ITCZ due to the earth’s rotation, which makes the multiple quasi equilibria of the ITCZ and monsoon onset possible. The other is the dramatic difference in such dependence when different cumulus parameterization schemes are used in a model. Such a difference can lead to a switch between a single ITCZ at the equator and a double ITCZ, when a different cumulus parameterization scheme is used. Sometimes one of the double ITCZ can diminish and only the other remains strong, but still this can mean different latitudinal locations for the single ITCZ.},

	abstract = {The monsoon is interpreted as an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) substantially away (more than 10Њ) from the equator and the existence of the ITCZ does not have to rely on land–sea contrast. Land–sea contrast can provide a favorable longitudinal location for the ITCZ but this role can be replaced by sea surface temperature contrast in the longitudinal direction. Thus, the interpretation of the monsoon presented herein differs from the long-held fundamental belief that its basic cause is land–sea thermal contrast on the continental scale in the sense that the existence of landmass is not considered a necessary condition for monsoons. Through general circulation model experiments, support has been found for this interpretation. The Asian and Australian summer monsoon circulations are largely intact in an experiment in which Asia, maritime continent, and Australia are replaced by ocean with sea surface temperature (SST) taken from that of the surrounding oceans. Thus, in these areas land–sea contrast is not a necessary condition for monsoon. This also happens to the Central American summer monsoon. The same thing can also be said about the African and South American summer monsoons, if these continents are replaced by ocean of sufﬁciently high SST. It is also shown that in the Asian monsoon the change resulting from such replacement is due more to the removal of topography than to the removal of land–sea contrast. In the Asian and Australian winter monsoons land–sea contrast also plays only a minor role. The origin of the ITCZs and their latitudinal locations have been previously interpreted by Chao. The circulation associated with an off-equator ITCZ, previously interpreted by Chao and Chen through a modiﬁed Gill solution and brieﬂy described in this paper, explains the monsoon circulation. The longitudinal location of the ITCZ is determined by the distribution of surface conditions. ITCZs favor locations of high SST as in the western Paciﬁc and Indian oceans, or tropical landmass, due to land–sea contrast, as in tropical Africa and South America. Thus, the role of landmass, when it is important, in the origin of monsoons can be replaced by ocean of sufﬁciently high SST. Furthermore, the ITCZ circulation extends into the tropics in the other hemisphere to give rise to the winter monsoon circulation there. Also through the equivalence of land–sea contrast and high SST, it is argued that the basic monsoon onset mechanism proposed by Chao is valid for all monsoons.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review observations, theory and model results on the monsoon circulation of the Indian Ocean. We begin with a general overview, discussing wind-stress forcing ﬁelds and their anomalies, climatological distributions of stratiﬁcation, mixed-layer depths, altimetric sea-level distributions, and seasonal circulation patterns (Section 2). The three main monsoon circulation sections deal with the equatorial regime (Section 3), the Somali Current and western Arabian Sea (Section 4), and the Bay of Bengal, seasonally reversing monsoon currents south of India and Sri Lanka, and the eastern and central Arabian Sea (Section 5). For the equatorial regime, we discuss equatorial jets and undercurrents, their interactions with the eastern and western boundaries, and intraseasonal and vertically propagating signals. In the Somali Current section, we describe the ocean’s responses to the summer and winter monsoon winds, and outline the modelling efforts that have been carried out to understand them. In the Bay of Bengal section, we present observational and modeling evidence showing the importance of remote forcing from the east, which to a large extent originates along the equator. In the following three sections, we review the southern-hemisphere subtropical regime and its associated boundary currents (Section 6), the Indonesian Throughﬂow (Section 7), the Red Sea and Persian Gulf circulations (Section 8), and discuss aspects of their interactions with other Indian-Ocean circulations. Next, we describe the Indian Ocean’s deep and shallow meridional overturning cells (Section 9). Model results show large seasonal variability of the meridional overturning streamfunction and heat ﬂux, and we discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this variability. While the monsoon-driven variability of the deep cell is mostly a sloshing motion affecting heat storage, interesting water-mass transformations and monsoonal reversals occur in the shallow crossequatorial cell. In the mean, the shallow cell connects the subduction areas in the southern subtropics and parts of the Indonesian Throughﬂow waters with the upwelling areas of the northern hemisphere via the cross-equatorial Somali Current. Its near-surface branch includes a shallow equatorial roll that is seasonally reversing. We close by looking at coupled ocean-climate anomalies, in particular the large events that were observed in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean in 1993/94 and 1997/98. These events have been interpreted as an independent Indian-Ocean climate mode by some investigators and as an ENSO-forced anomaly by others.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The dew-point front was a transitional belt between the moist southwest monsoon ﬂow and the dry adiabatic sinking ﬂow, marked by a large horizontal moisture gradient in the mid-lower troposphere. The dew-point front and the Meiyu front, to its north side, formed the Meiyu front system (MYFS). The Meiyu front was the north branch of the MYFS, and extended northward in the mid-lower troposphere. The dew-point front was the south branch of the MYFS, located between 500 hPa and 700 hPa. Along the dew-point front (Meiyu), westerly (easterly) and easterly (westerly) winds prevailed in the lower (upper) and upper (lower) troposphere respectively. Strong ascending motion in the passsageway between the two fronts was surrounded by subsidence. Further, a frontogenesis function was used to diagnose the frontogenesis of the MYFS. The analysis indicated that the convergence and deformation of the horizontal wind were important factors responsible for both the formation and development of the Meiyu front and the dew-point front.},

	abstract = {Strong associations, in both the annual cycle and interannual variations, between east China monsoon rainfall and tropospheric jets are established with the use of observations and general-circulation model simulations. n o distinct systems dominate regional rainfall: the east Asian jet stream (EM)in the north and the Hadley cell in the south. The EAJ is associated with Mei-Yu and polar fronts as well as vigorous jet-transverse circulations, whereas the Hadley cell is allied to tropical upper-level easterlies and intertropical convergence zone convection. An equatorward EAJ displacement causes precipitation to increase over south-central (south) China during JuneAugust (January-March). Conversely, a poleward shift of the summer (winter) EAJ brings heavier precipitation over north (central-north) China. On the other hand, over the South China Seathe Hadley cell influence prevails and, consequently, increased rainfalls concur with enhanced lower-level westerlies. Furthermore, the EAJ fluctuations are strongly coupled with southern oscillation variations. Their interactions tend to precede (follow) El Niiio phenomena during October through May (summer). The EAJ related flow anomalies also have potential skill to predict China rainfall interannual variability. To conclude, a realistic China monsoon simulation requires accurate representation of the EAJ and Hadley cell. Both features link regional rainfall to tropical and extratropical planetaryscale circulations and, in turn, to global surface characteristics.},

	abstract = {The mean evolution of the Asian summer monsoon and its interannual variability have been studied using three simulations (from 1961 to 1994) with the ECHAM4 General Circulation Model (GCM). The results have been compared with observational data and with two reanalyses data sets: the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA) and the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis. The South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) has been studied in terms of mean precipitation and circulation patterns. The model is successful in simulating the mean circulation of the SASM, though precipitation is generally weaker than observed in India, but closer to the observed values over the Indian Ocean and the Philippines. The ECHAM4 model also shows a capability to capture the interannual variability of the monsoon as it is measured by two different indices, the EIMR (Extended Indian Monsoon Rainfall) index and the DMI (Dynamical Monsoon Index). An analysis of NINO3 SSTA anomalies and of the Asian summer monsoon indices showed that the model is able to capture rather well the interdecadal variation of the correlation between them. A large ensemble of 25 members, forced with interannually varying SST from 1979 to 1993, has been used to test the potential predictability of the Indian summer monsoon and the dependence of the skill on the ensemble size. Results indicate that a minimum ensemble size of 16 members is needed to capture the variability of the monsoon indices.},

	abstract = {The oxygen-18 isotope composition of calcite in stalagmites across southern and eastern Asia are highly correlated to one another on orbital time scales: large negative excursions are coincident with maxima in summer insolation in the subtropics of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). These isotopic excursions reﬂect changes in the precipitation-weighted isotopic composition of precipitation, ������18Op. We present results from two core experiments using an isotope-enabled climate model—the“high-insolation” and “low-insolation” experiments—in which the model is forced by extrema in NH summer insolation. Compared to the low-insolation experiment, the high-insolation climate features profound, large-scale changes in the pattern of monsoon precipitation spanning from Africa to Southeast Asia that are due to changes in the relative contributions of temperature and moisture to the near-surface equivalent potential temperature ������e. Under high insolation, a more rapid increase in land surface temperature in early summer causes the greatest ������e (and hence precipitation) to shift from the oceans in low insolation (such as today) to be over land in high insolation (such as the early Holocene). The model captures the general pattern of isotopic excursions seen in caves spanning from Israel to western China, including large drops in ������18Op over eastern Tibet (−7‰), the Arabian Peninsula, and northeast Africa (−4‰). Although there are large changes in precipitation over Tibet, the change in ������18Op is due to changes in the ������18O of water vapor that is delivered and subsequently precipitated; it does not inform on local precipitation amount or intensity.},

	abstract = {Past research on the climate response to orbital forcing has emphasized the glacial-interglacial variations in global ice volume, global-mean temperature, and the global hydrologic cycle. This emphasis may be inappropriate in the tropics, where the response to precessional forcing is likely to be somewhat independent of the glacial-interglacial variations, particularly in variables relating to the hydrologic cycle. To illustrate this point, we use an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab ocean model, performing experiments that quantify the tropical climate’s response to (1) opposite phases of precessional forcing, and (2) Last Glacial Maximum boundary conditions. While the glacially-forced tropical temperature changes are typically more than an order of magnitude larger than those arising from precessional forcing, the hydrologic signals stemming from the two forcings are comparable in magnitude. The mechanisms behind these signals are investigated and shown to be quite distinct for the precessional and glacial forcing. Because of strong dynamical linkages in the tropics, the model results illustrate the impossibility of predicting the local hydrologic response to external forcing without understanding the response at much larger spatial scales. Examples from the paleoclimate record are presented as additional evidence for the importance of precessional signals in past variations of the tropical climate.},

	abstract = {We investigate how the representation of the boundary layer in a climate model impacts the representation of the near-surface wind and dust emission, with a focus on the Sahel/Sahara region. We show that the combination of vertical turbulent diffusion with a representation of the thermal cells of the convective boundary layer by a mass ﬂux scheme leads to realistic representation of the diurnal cycle of wind in spring, with a maximum near-surface wind in the morning. This maximum occurs when the thermal plumes reach the low-level jet that forms during the night at a few hundred meters above surface. The horizontal momentum in the jet is transported downward to the surface by compensating subsidence around thermal plumes in typically less than 1 h. This leads to a rapid increase of wind speed at surface and therefore of dust emissions owing to the strong nonlinearity of emission laws. The numerical experiments are performed with a zoomed and nudged conﬁguration of the LMDZ general circulation model coupled to the emission module of the CHIMERE chemistry transport model, in which winds are relaxed toward that of the ERA-Interim reanalyses. The new set of parameterizations leads to a strong improvement of the representation of the diurnal cycle of wind when compared to a previous version of LMDZ as well as to the reanalyses used for nudging themselves. It also generates dust emissions in better agreement with current estimates, but the aerosol optical thickness is still signiﬁcantly underestimated.},

	abstract = {This study presents the version of the LMDZ global atmospheric model used as the atmospheric component of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace coupled model (IPSL-CM6A-LR) to contribute to the 6th phase of the international Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). This LMDZ6A version includes original convective parameterizations that define the LMDZ “New Physics”: a mass flux parameterization of the organized structures of the convective boundary layer, the “thermal plume model,” and a parameterization of the cold pools created by reevaporation of convective rainfall. The vertical velocity associated with thermal plumes and gust fronts of cold pools are used to control the triggering and intensity of deep convection. Because of several shortcomings, the early version 5B of this New Physics was worse than the previous “Standard Physics” version 5A regarding several classical climate metrics. To overcome these deficiencies, version 6A includes new developments: a stochastic triggering of deep convection, a modification of the thermal plume model that allows the representation of stratocumulus and cumulus clouds in a unified framework, an improved parameterization of very stable boundary layers, and the modification of the gravity waves scheme targeting the quasi-biennal oscillation in the stratosphere. These improvements to the physical content and a more well-defined tuning strategy led to major improvements in the LMDZ6A version model climatology. Beyond the presentation of this particular model version and documentation of its climatology, the present paper underlines possible methodological pathways toward model improvement that can be shared across modeling groups.},

Although limited, the dental and postcranial material is sufﬁcient to identify the genera Amphitragulus and Mosaicomeryx, two common forms known from middle to late Oligocene deposits of Europe, thus reinforcing the ‘middle’ Oligocene age of the lowermost Chitarwata Formation. Mosaicomeryx is reported for the ﬁrst time from the Indian Subcontinent and this occurrence considerably expands its geographical distribution. A new genus and species, Paalitherium gurki, is erected on the basis of an unusual and unique association of characters on its lower molars. The unclear deﬁnition and occurrences of? Gelocus gajensis Pilgrim, 1912 are re-examined in the light of new data from the Bugti and Zinda Pir areas (Pakistan). The new ruminant fauna from Paali is clearly distinctive from the early Miocene assemblage known from Bugti. In accordance with other fossil evidence, the ruminant fauna described here suggests the existence of a tropical forested environment under monsoonal regime with soft food supplies during the time of deposition of the lowermost Chitarwata Formation.},

Here, we integrate 58 pollen records with wellconstrained chronologies from across Asia, and use the biomization method to quantitatively reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of the vegetation. The results reveal the occurrence of desert in Northwest China during {\textasciitilde}43–35 Ma, indicating a dry climate. After {\textasciitilde}22 Ma there was a further expansion of desert and steppe in Northwest China, indicating the existence of a permanent arid environment. The aridity was intensiﬁed after {\textasciitilde}8–7 Ma, evidenced by the replacement of forest by steppe and desert. We suggest that the permanent aridiﬁcation since 22 Ma was related to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, and that the enhanced aridiﬁcation since {\textasciitilde}8–7 Ma was caused by ongoing global cooling.},

Based on current knowledge of the associated fauna, this new species of Apidium is early Oligocene in age, being roughly contemporaneous with faunas from Quarries G and V in the upper part of the Jebel Qatrani Formation in Egypt that also contain species of Apidium. A phylogenetic analysis based on dental characters indicates that the new species of Apidium from Libya is the sister group of Apidium phiomense. Apidium bowni and Apidium moustafai from the Jebel Qatrani Formation in the Fayum are similar in age to the new species of Apidium from Libya, but both of these Egyptian species are more distantly related to A. phiomense from younger stratigraphic levels in the Fayum. This phylogenetic pattern underscores the beneﬁt of enhanced geographic sampling of the fossil record, even in cases where local records are thought to be reasonably comprehensive and well documented. Oligocene parapithecids can be partitioned into two clades corresponding to the subfamilies Parapithecinae (containing Parapithecus and Simonsius) and Qatraniinae (including Qatrania and Apidium). Climatic deterioration during the early Oligocene may have impacted the macroevolutionary dynamics of early Afro-Arabian anthropoids by fostering the fragmentation of forest habitats, thereby promoting allopatric speciation among widespread populations of Apidium and other arboreal taxa.},

Such a transition is recorded in both marine and terrestrial records. The latter is more fragmentary and thus comparatively less well known from a climatic point of view. Leaves are abundant fossil remains, which can be used as terrestrial climatic proxies. In this study, several historical collections from France and Belgium were re-investigated. We applied the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program in order to document the regional past climate from middle Paleocene to middle Miocene in Western Europe. Our analysis suggest relatively cooler conditions during middle Paleocene, followed by a gradual increase of mean annual temperature and precipitation seasonality during late Paleocene; increased temperature seasonality rather than a global cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene transition; an increase of temperature between early and late Oligocene and warm temperate climate in Western Europe similar to other parts of Europe during middle Miocene. These results are broadly consistent with the global trends observed through the Cenozoic era in the marine record. This study provides new quantitative paleoclimatic estimates for various key periods of the Cenozoic era in Western Europe. The consistency of our results with previous studies based on multiples proxies is in favor of the use of historical collections to reconstruct past climates, as long as sufficient sampling is provided.},

	abstract = {The opening of the Drake Passage (DP) during the Cenozoic is a tectonic event of paramount importance for the development of modern ocean characteristics. Notably, it has been suggested that it exerts a primary role in the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) formation, in the cooling of high‐latitude South Atlantic waters and in the initiation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation. Several model studies have aimed to assess the impacts of DP opening on climate, but most of them focused on surface climate, and only few used realistic Eocene boundary conditions. Here, we revisit the impact of the DP opening on ocean circulation with the IPSL‐CM5A2 Earth System Model. Using appropriate middle Eocene (40 Ma) boundary conditions, we perform and analyze simulations with different depths of the DP (0, 100, 1,000, and 2,500 m) and compare results to existing geochemical data. Our experiments show that DP opening has a strong effect on Eocene ocean structure and dynamics even for shallow depths. The DP opening notably allows the formation of a proto‐ACC and induces deep ocean cooling of 1.5°C to 2.5°C in most of the Southern Hemisphere. There is no NADW formation in our simulations regardless of the depth of the DP, suggesting that the DP on its own is not a primary control of deepwater formation in the North Atlantic. This study elucidates how and to what extent the opening of the DP contributed to the establishment of the modern global thermohaline circulation.},

The interhemispheric insolation change is associated with weakening of the cross-equatorial Hadley circulation and reduced heat transport from the summer hemisphere to the winter hemisphere, in both the ocean and atmosphere. In contrast, the intrahemispheric insolation change is associated with increased midlatitude summer eddy activity as seen by the increased atmospheric heat transport at those latitudes. Analysis of the zonal mean atmospheric meridional overturning circulation on isentropic surfaces conﬁrms the increase of the midlatitude eddy circulation, which is driven by changes of sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes, as well as changes in the stratiﬁcation or distribution of entropy. It is suggested that the strengthening of this circulation is associated with an equatorward shift of the ascending branch of the winter Hadley cell.},

	abstract = {Soil physical properties play an important role in estimating soil water and energy ﬂuxes. Many hydrological and land surface models (LSMs) use soil texture maps to infer these properties. Here, we investigate the impact of soil texture on soil water ﬂuxes and storage at different scales using the ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms) LSM, forced by several complex or globally uniform soil texture maps. At the point scale, the model shows a realistic sensitivity of runoff processes and soil moisture to soil texture and reveals that loamy textures give the highest evapotranspiration and lowest total runoff rates. The three tested complex soil texture maps result in similar water budgets at all scales, compared to the uncertainties of observation-based products and meteorological forcing datasets, although important differences can be found at the regional scale, particularly in areas where the different maps disagree on the prevalence of clay soils. The three tested soil texture maps are also found to be similar by construction, with a shared prevalence of loamy textures, and have a spatial overlap over 40 \% between each pair of maps, which explains the overall weak impact of soil texture map change. A useful outcome is that the choice of the input soil texture map is not crucial for large-scale modelling, but the added value of more detailed soil information (horizontal and vertical resolution, soil composition) deserves further studies.},

	abstract = {A scheme for the representation of subgrid-scale orography (SSO) in numerical weather prediction and climate models is presented. the new scheme arose in part from a desire to represent nonlinear low-level mountain drag effects not currently parametrized. an important feature of the scheme is that it deals explicitly with a low-level flow which is ‘blocked’, when the effective height of the subgrid-scale orography is sufficiently high. In this new scheme, it is assumed that, for this ‘blocked’ flow, separation occurs at the mountain flanks, resulting in a form drag. This drag is parametrized on model levels which are intersected by the SSO, and provides a dynamically based replacement for envelope orography. the upper part of the low-level flow goes over the orography and generates gravity waves. At the model resolutions considered (T106 and T213) it is assumed that the length scales characteristic of the SSO are sufficiently small for the Coriolis force to be neglected. the various parameters of the scheme are adjusted using an off-line procedure in which the scheme is used to estimate the mountain drag and the momentum profiles above the Pyrenees; and these estimates are validated with the PYREX data. Forecasts using T106 and T213 resolutions with this new scheme, and with mean orography, show that the forecast mountain drag consistently reproduces the drag measured during PYREX whenever the flow component normal to the ridge is large. Isentropic flow diagnostics, further, show that the new scheme has a realistic impact on the flow dynamics, reinforcing the low-level wake observed in mesoscale analyses of the flow. With this new scheme and a mean orography, the ECMWF model outperformed, in forecast skill, a version of the model which had an envelope orography and the old gravity-wave-drag scheme, while no longer suffering any disadvantages of envelope orography. the proposed low-level drag parametrization should also be relevant at model horizontal resolutions much higher than T213.},

The paper presents a new WBM where the spectral integration is performed
with the help of wide-band transmissivities specially designed to
accurately account for variations in temperature and pressure along the
optical paths. This WBM is derived from a detailed NBM and uses a hybrid
scheme to handle the vertical integration. When applied to standard
atmospheric profiles, fluxes and cooling rates obtained with this WBM
agree within 1 percent and 0.1 K/day respectively with those computed by
the NBM. For various changes in H2O and CO2 distributions, sensitivities
computed by both models generally agree within 10 percent. When
introduced in a GCM, maximum differences in fluxes at the boundaries and
in cooling rate are 1.5 and 10 percent, respectively.},

	abstract = {Plant fossils from the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China are critical to understand not only the diversiﬁcation history of plants there, but also the paleoenvironmental conditions. Alnus are deciduous trees, mainly distributed in temperate and subtropical regions of Eurasia and North America, and they are well known in the fossil records throughout the Cenozoic in the Northern Hemisphere. We collected numerous well-preserved Alnus leaf and infructescence fossils from the Lawula Formation (\$34.6 Ma with 40Ar/39Ar dating) at the present elevation of 3910 m a.s.l. in the southeastern QTP. Based on detailed morphological comparisons with existing and fossil species, these fossils show closest afﬁnity to Alnus ferdinandi-coburgii C. K. Schneid., and we refer to these fossils as A. cf. ferdinandicoburgii. These specimens comprise the oldest megafossil record of Alnus in the QTP, and provide solid evidence for the distribution of Alnus there as early as the late Eocene. Extant A. ferdinandi-coburgii is distributed in areas with mean annual temperature values between 9.7 °C and 16.9 °C, and mean annual precipitation values ranging from 896.2 mm to 1161.2 mm; therefore, fossils of A. cf. ferdinandi-coburgii suggest a much warmer and wetter climate during the late Eocene than today in the southeastern QTP. This ﬁnding is consistent with other evidence for continued uplift of the southeastern QTP after the late Eocene that might be due to the eastward extension of the QTP.},

	abstract = {A minimum-complexity tectonic reconstruction, based on published and new basin opening models, depicts how the Scotia Sea grew by Cenozoic plate divergence, dismembering a Jurassic sheared margin of Gondwana. Part of the Jurassic–early Cretaceous ocean that accreted to this margin forms the core of the Central Scotia Plate, the arc plate above a trench at the eastern end of the Scotia Sea, which migrated east away from the Antarctic and South American plates. A sequence of extensional basins opened on the western edge of the Central Scotia Plate at 50–30 Ma, decoupled from the South American Plate to the northwest by slow motion on a long transform fault. Succeeding the basins, seaﬂoor spreading started around 30 Ma on the West Scotia Ridge, which propagated northwards in the 23–17 Ma period and ceased to operate at 6 Ma. The circuits of plate motions inside and outside the Scotia Arc are joined via rotations that describe Antarctic–Central Scotia plate motion in Powell Basin until 20 Ma, and along the South Scotia Ridge thereafter. The modelled relative motion at the northern edge of the Scotia Sea is thus constrained only by the plate circuit, but nonetheless resembles that known coarsely from the geological record of Tierra del Fuego. A paleobathymetric interpretation of nine time slices in the model shows Drake Passage developing as an intermediate-depth oceanographic gateway at 50–30 Ma, with deep ﬂow possible afterwards. Initially, this deep ﬂow would have been made tortuous by numerous intermediate and shallow barriers. A frontal pattern resembling that in the modern Scotia Sea would have awaited the clearance of signiﬁcant barriers by continuing seaﬂoor spreading in the Scotia Sea at {\textasciitilde}18.5 Ma, at Shag Rocks Passage, and after 10 Ma southeast of South Georgia.},

	abstract = {For a long time, evaporitic sequences have been interpreted as indicative of an arid climate. Such systematic interpretations led to the suggestion that the Central segment of the South Atlantic (20–0◦) was characterized by an arid climate during the upper Aptian. Indeed, synchronous to this period that corresponds to the rifting and to the opening of this part of the South Atlantic, a large evaporitic sequence spreads out from the equator to 20◦ S. Using the fully ocean atmosphere coupled model FOAM, we test the potential for the Aptian geography to produce an arid area over the Central segment. Sensitivity to the altitude of the rift shoulders separating the Africa and the South America cratons, to the water depth of the Central segment and to the drainage pattern have been performed. Using seawater salinity as a diagnostic, our simulations show that the southern part of the Central segment is characterized by very high salinity in the case of catchment areas draining the water out of the Central segment. Conversely, whatever the boundary conditions used, the northern part of the Central segment remains humid and salinities are very low. Hence, we conclude that the evaporites deposited in the southern part of the Central segment may have been controlled by the climate favouring aridity and high saline waters. In contrast, the evaporites of the northern part can hardly be reconciled with the climatic conditions occurring there and may be due to hydrothermal sources. Our interpretations are in agreement with the gradient found in the mineralogical compositions of the evaporites from the North to the South, i.e. the northern evaporites are at least 4 times more concentrated than the southern one.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the orbital signal in Earth’s climate with a coupled model of intermediate complexity (ECBilt). The orbital influence on climate is studied by isolating the obliquity and precession signal in several time-slice experiments. Focus is on monsoonal systems with emphasis on the African summer monsoon. The model shows that both the precession and the obliquity signal in the African summer monsoon consists of an intensified precipitation maximum and further northward extension during minimum precession and maximum obliquity than during maximum precession and minimum obliquity. In contrast to obliquity, precession also influences the seasonal timing of the occurrence of the maximum precipitation. The response of the African monsoon to orbital-induced insolation forcing can be divided into a response to insolation forcing at high northern latitudes and a response to insolation forcing at low latitudes, whereby the former dominates. The results also indicate that the amplitude of the precipitation response to obliquity depends on precession, while the precipitation response to precession is independent of obliquity. Our model experiments provide an explanation for the precession and obliquity signals in sedimentary records of the Mediterranean (e.g., Lourens et al. [Paleoceanography 11 (1996) 391, Nature 409 (2001) 1029]), through monsoon-induced variations in Nile river outflow and northern Africa aridity.},

	abstract = {This paper reports our primary effort in the quantitative reconstruction of paleoclimate based on the thrine in phytoecology of the affinity parent plants in the stratigraphic pollen records. The Eocene pollen data come from our former study on the Mingjia borehole 1 in the Jianghan basin. The fluctuating trend in the parameter curve of climate shows that the climate in the Middle Eocene in the Jianghan basin was more or less comparable with that of the present 22° {\textasciitilde} 26° N, characteristic of a humid, semi{\textasciitilde}humid central southern subtropical climate. The annual temperature at that time dropped by 1 ℃ {\textasciitilde} 4 ℃ in the Late Eocene, approximately equal to that of the present 23° {\textasciitilde} 28° N of northern{\textasciitilde}central subtropical climate. However, the climate composite at that time, characterized by higher temperature, small annual range and big fluctuation in precipitation, was quite different from the present one. The average temperature in January in the Middle Eocene, higher than that of today, ranged between 5 ℃ and 9 ℃, indicating that no effect of winter monsoon occurred in the Middle Eocene, though such an effect may have occurred occasionally in the Late Eocene. Major temperature decline is recognized at the depth of 2 100 m in the borehole, as was indicated by the decline in average January temperature, the increase in annual range, and the increase in the deciduous broad leaved types of trees in the spore{\textasciitilde}pollen assemblage. The sharp fluctuation in the annual precipitation, usually raging from 300 to 1 700 mm, was favorable for the migration and accumulation of salty deposit. When the precipitation was lower than 1 000 mm, ephemera shrub increased at the same depth as that of the salty deposit. It is, therefore, deduced that the formation of the salty deposit was attributed mainly to the dry and hot environment in the high mountains and deep basins. The small annual precipitation and the intense fluctuation are favorable for the sustainable accumulation of the salts, which is different from the present salty accumulation in the Northwest China},

	abstract = {This study is the first to employ spectral analysis to examine meter-scale sedimentary cyclicity in the Wilkins Peak Member of the lower Eocene Green River Formation of Wyoming. Generally regarded as the classic example for orbital forcing of lacustrine sediments at eccentricity and precession time scales, this long-standing interpretation was recently contested, with a much shorter duration (≤10 ky) inferred for the dominant cyclicity. Earlier work lacked adequate age control or spectral analysis or both. Our analysis is based upon an evaluation in the frequency domain of oil-yield values from four boreholes, accuracy estimation for suggested orbital interpretations, and comparison to independent geochronology. Cored intervals 266–364 m thick represent a span of 1.2–1.7 m.y., with temporal resolution of ∼3–5 ky (∼1 m) for oil-yield values. Variations in spectral power with depth within the original records are interpreted to reflect changes in the rate of sediment accumulation. These changes are corrected prior to testing the orbital forcing hypothesis by using two methods: 1) a minimal adjustment (three segments) accounting for the dominant changes of spectral frequency with depth; and 2) correlating the published definitions of precessional cycles in these records to a 21 ky cosine curve. Orbital age models resulting from the two tuning methods are compared to available chronology and the tuned records are tested for the expected spectral peaks from orbitally forced records. We conclude that the dominant cyclicity of the Wilkins Peak Member is orbitally forced. Orbital age models overlap 40Ar/39Ar ages and inferred periods include long and short eccentricity, weak obliquity and precession. Eccentricity is resolved in the analyzed records but the expected ∼95 and ∼125 ky periods are not resolved, controlling the range of possible tuning periods and the accuracy of orbital age models. Sub-Milankovitch variability exists and can be resolved to a minimum period of ∼3–5 ky by the analyzed records. However, it cannot be characterized fully with the available chronology or by the previously calculated mean cycle duration.},

	abstract = {Although orbital forcing is commonly proposed as the driver of ancient sedimentary rhythms, the lack of adequate independent time control (radio isotopic data) to calibrate these cycles has stood as a major challenge to evaluation of the hypothesis. Here I apply a new statistical approach to evaluate cyclicity in two historically important rhythmic units for which orbital forcing has been proposed: the Triassic Latemar Limestone (Dolomites, Italy) and the Eocene Green River Formation (Wyoming, USA). A major advance of the new method is its explicit evaluation of the null hypothesis of no orbital signal. The null hypothesis can be rejected with a high degree of conﬁdence in the Latemar Limestone (probability {\textless}0.30\%) and Green River Formation (probability {\textless}0.07\%). The analyses also resolve controversies about the speciﬁc orbital calibrations at each site. Both data series reveal the expected precession, obliquity, and eccentricity orbital components, and yield astrochronologies that are consistent with proposed radio isotopic based time scales.},

	abstract = {The Piceance Creek basin formed as a continental foreland basin ca 53 to 48 Ma in the early to middle Eocene. On a global basis, the basin contains one of the richest oil shale resources known, where the profundal oil shale deposits, kerogen-rich mudstones (clay and carbonate), exist over most of the basin. Despite its economic importance, the evolution of the Piceance Creek basin is still somewhat unclear. Based on facies association analysis, depositional trends, and gamma ray and Fischer assay data, six evolutionary lake stages are recognized: (i) fresh lake; (ii) transitional lake; (iii) highly ﬂuctuating lake; (iv) rising lake; (v) high lake; and (vi) closing lake. Lake stages are composed of depositional units and characterize large-scale changes in sedimentological patterns, depositional trends and ﬂuctuations in the oil shale richness related to changes in climate and tectonics. Lake stage evolution is also consistent with the global Eocene climate trend. Stage 1 formed prior to the Eocene climate optimum. At the beginning of the Eocene climate optimum, a saline-restricted lake formed (Stage 2) and evolved into the highly ﬂuctuating lake (Stage 3) indicating rapid climate changes during the peak of the Eocene climate optimum. This stage was followed by the rising and high lakes (Stages 4 and 5) after the climate optimum and during a change to a more humid climate. The closing of the lake (Stage 6) was caused by increased sand input from the north, indicating the inﬂuence of both tectonics and climate. Based on depositional trends and climate evolution, it is suggested that, during the arid climate, laterally heterogeneous highly cyclic depositional units dominate, whereas, during the humid climate, depositional units form laterally continuous sediments that can be traced over long distances.},

Six of nine zircon analyses from the Firehole ash yield concordant ages in an overlapping cluster and give a weighted mean 238U-206Pb age of 51.66 ± 0.20 Ma (full external 2σ uncertainty), indistinguishable from the recalibrated 40Ar/39Ar age of 51.40 ± 0.25 Ma (full external 2σ uncertainty), which is adjusted to eliminate samples with low radiogenic 40Ar*. Signiﬁcant 238U-206Pb age scatter likely reﬂects some combination of minor inheritance, Pb loss, and possibly magma chamber residence. Seven of eight analyses of Analcite ash zircon yield a weighted mean 238U-206Pb age of 49.23 ± 0.13 Ma (full external 2σ uncertainty), whereas the sanidine 40Ar/39Ar age is 49.24 ± 0.18 Ma (full external 2σ uncertainty). Calibrating Green River Formation 40Ar/39Ar ages to the 28.201 Ma age for Fish Canyon sanidine permits the ﬁrst direct comparison of speciﬁc Green River Formation strata to the astronomical solution for Early Eocene insolation. This comparison supports the hypothesis that periods of ﬂuvial deposition coincided with minima in long and short eccentricity, and that periods of lake expansion and evaporite deposition correspond to eccentricity maxima.},

We use the XRF counts of iron and calcium as a proxy of the relative contribution from calcium carbonate and terrestrial material to construct a new composite depth record. This new composite depth record provides the basis to extend the astronomically calibrated geological time scale into the Middle Eocene and results in revised estimates for the age and duration of magnetochrons C16 through C18. In addition, we find an apparent change in the dominance of orbitally driven changes in obliquity and climatic precession at around 36.7 Ma on our new time scale. Long term amplitude modulation patterns of eccentricity and obliquity in the data do not seem to match the current astronomical model any more, suggesting the possibility of new constraints on astronomical calculations. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {This paper presents new magnetostratigraphic results from a 1100-m-thick composite section across the marine to continental sediments of the central part of the SE margin of the Ebro basin (NE Spain). Integration with existing marine and continental biochronological data allows a robust correlation with the geomagnetic polarity time scale.The resulting absolute chronology ranges from 36.3 to 31.1 Ma (Priabonian to Rupelian), and yields an interpolated age of \$36.0 Ma (within chron C16n.2n) for the youngest marine sediments of the eastern Ebro basin.This age is in concordance with a reinterpretation of earlier magnetostratigraphic data from the western South Pyrenean foreland basin, and indicates that continentalization of the basin occurred as a rapid and isochronous event. The basin continentalization, determined by the seaway closure that resulted from the uplift of the western Pyrenees, was probably coincident with a mid-amplitude eustatic sea level low with a maximum at 36.2 Ma.The base level drop that followed the basin closure and desiccation does not appear associated to a signi¢cant sedimentary hiatus along the margins, suggesting a late Eocene shallow marine basin that rapidly re¢lled and raised its base level after the seaway closing. Rapid basin ¢lling following continentalization predates the phase of rapid exhumation of the Central Pyrenean Axial Zone from 35.0 to 32.0 Ma, determined from the thermochronology data. It is possible then that sediment aggradation at the front of the fold-and-thrust belt could have contributed to a decrease in the taper angle, triggering growth of the inner orogenic wedge through break-back thrusting and underplating. Contrasting sedimentation trends between the western and eastern sectors of the South Pyrenean foreland indicate that basin closing preferentially a¡ected those areas subjected to sediment bypass towards the ocean domain. As a result, sediment ponding after basin closure is responsible for a two -fold increase of sedimentation rates in the western sector, while changes of sedimentation rates are undetected in the more restricted scenario of the eastern Ebro basin.},

	abstract = {We present here a new solution for the astronomical computation of the insolation quantities on Earth spanning from −250 Myr to 250 Myr. This solution has been improved with respect to La93 (Laskar et al. 1993) by using a direct integration of the gravitational equations for the orbital motion, and by improving the dissipative contributions, in particular in the evolution of the Earth–Moon System. The orbital solution has been used for the calibration of the Neogene period (Lourens et al. 2004), and is expected to be used for age calibrations of paleoclimatic data over 40 to 50 Myr, eventually over the full Palaeogene period (65 Myr) with caution. Beyond this time span, the chaotic evolution of the orbits prevents a precise determination of the Earth’s motion. However, the most regular components of the orbital solution could still be used over a much longer time span, which is why we provide here the solution over 250 Myr. Over this time interval, the most striking feature of the obliquity solution, apart from a secular global increase due to tidal dissipation, is a strong decrease of about 0.38 degree in the next few millions of years, due to the crossing of the s6 + g5 − g6 resonance (Laskar et al. 1993). For the calibration of the Mesozoic time scale (about 65 to 250 Myr), we propose to use the term of largest amplitude in the eccentricity, related to g2 − g5, with a ﬁxed frequency of 3.200 /yr, corresponding to a period of 405 000 yr. The uncertainty of this time scale over 100 Myr should be about 0.1\%, and 0.2\% over the full Mesozoic era.},

	abstract = {In addition to being of interest to ancient Greek and Roman historians, the site of Philippi, NE Greece, has long been noted in Quaternary circles for providing the longest continuous European pollen record, spanning the last one million years. Here the original age model is re-evaluated and a new marine-terrestrial correlation is proposed. An astronomical calibration procedure, based on a correspondence between changes in certain vegetation elements and March and June perihelion conﬁgurations, suggests that the base of the sequence extends back to 1.35 million years ago. The revised chronological framework for the Tenaghi Philippon sequence provides an opportunity to examine the long-term behaviour of individual taxa and vegetation trends within the context of global climate changes. Comparisons reveal a close correspondence between the terrestrial and marine records, in terms of orbital and suborbital variability. However, joint time-frequency analysis of the arboreal pollen record shows that the obliquity and eccentricity/precession signals persist into the ‘100-kyr’ and ‘41-kyr’ worlds, respectively, suggesting the operation of additional climate mechanisms that are independent of high-latitude glacial–interglacial effects. Unlike ice core and marine sequences, no change in the magnitude of interglacial tree population expansions is observed after the Mid-Brunhes Event. Instead, the Tenaghi Philippon record suggests a major shift in the vegetational composition of interglacials after MIS 16, with the establishment of forests of reduced diversity and a ‘modern’ appearance.},

	abstract = {Although largely circumstantial in character, evidence for orbitally-forced (Milankovitch) climate changes in Jurassic microrhythmic successions, such as those of the Lias and Kimmeridgian, is becoming more persuasive. We present here the results of experiments, using a general circulation model, testing ways in which orbitally-induced variations in solar energy might be translated into a Jurassic climate response. In particular, we address the problem of the 100 ka (eccentricity-forced)cycle. This is generally considered to have only a small direct effect on solar input. It would be expected to have little impact on an ice-free Earth (commonly assumed for the Jurassic). Nonetheless, this weak signal is claimed to have been recognized in many Jurassic successions. Our results simulate, for the Late Jurassic, the possible effects at the 'minimum' and 'maximum' extremes of seasonal forcing (i.e. comparable with those affecting the Earth at 115 and 9 ka BP,respectively). Model predictions are critically evaluated against the geological database. At times of 'minimum seasonal forcing' there is a significant expansion in the area of the Northern hemisphere monsoon. In the tropics, changes in precipitation predominate over changes in temperature, whereas at high southern latitudes there are very large seasonal variations in temperature, and heavy winter snows. During these times the model is close to predicting a modest, but significant, Jurassic ice-cap in the Antarctic. Ice build-up is particularly likely over uplands. Such an ice-cap disappears at times of 'maximum seasonal forcing'. Waxing and waning of ice may thus provide the elusive mechanism for metre-scale sea-level changes. It is argued that apparently similar microrhythms (e.g. limestone-shale) might be the sedimentary response to different climatic signals in different climate zones, cause and effect being exactly the opposite in some circumstances.},

	abstract = {Long-term climatic changes, such as glacial{\textasciicircum}interglacial cycles, are usually explained in term of changes in solar energy received at the top of the atmosphere. In particular, daily insolation in the high Northern Hemisphere latitudes during summer is widely used in interpreting palaeoclimate records. This insolation forcing is strongly marked by changes in precession. However, some climate variations are much more imprinted by changes in obliquity. This was the case for sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic during the Eemian period, as well as for the Vostok ice core deuterium excess history over the last 250 ka. Therefore, we investigate the insolation forcing in order to identify characteristics that could explain the observed climate response. This is mainly the case for annual mean insolation variations. Simple hypotheses for how this forcing could act on climate are also suggested, these being mainly related to changes in the moisture transport induced by the annual insolation gradient between low and high latitudes. Along these lines, a simple conceptual model of annual mean temperature variations illustrates the role of annual mean insolation on climate.},

These records, in conjunction with a simple coupled climate model, help us understand major mechanisms of paleoclimatic variability. The time intervals covered by the records include the last glacial-interglacial cycle. In spite of the difference in the nature of the records, common features are revealed by advanced spectral-analysis tools. The dominant features are the presence of orbital frequencies, on the one hand, and a low number of internal degrees of freedom, on the other. The climatic system appears therefore to act on the Quaternary time scales considered as a forced nonlinear oscillator. The internal mechanisms giving rise to the aperiodic oscillations include ice-albedo feedback, precipitation-temperature feedback, and interactions between the ice sheets and the bedrock.},

The long-term evolution of the index mirrors almost exactly the insolation changes at 65‡N, showing that the forcing of low latitude climate variability has a structure similar to that of the insolation forcing in the high northern latitudes. Moreover, insolation forcing in the low latitudes directly controls atmospheric processes in the African, Indian and Asian Monsoon, being responsible for a huge amount of transequatorial water vapour and therefore latent heat transport. Millennial-scale variability of the monsoonal climate is concentrated at periodicities near 1100, 1450, 1750 and 2300 years. These cycles are not strictly periodic, but occur in bands, with specific activity phases and amplitude increases during warm stages and interstadials for the 1100- and 1750-yr cycles, whereas the 1450-yr cycle dominates the cold intervals.},

	abstract = {The astronomical theory of climate, in which the orbital variations of the Earth are taken to drive the climate changes, explains many features of the paleoclimatic records. Nevertheless, the precise link between insolation variations and climatic changes during the Quaternary remains mysterious in several aspects. In particular, the largest sea level changes of the past million years occurred when insolation variations were minimal, like during stage 11, and vice versa like during stage 7. Moreover, recent data from terminations II and III show surprising phase lead and lag between insolation and sea level variations. To explain these paradoxical amplitude and phase modulations, we suggest here that deglaciations started when a combination of insolation and ice volume was large enough. To illustrate this new idea, we present a simple conceptual model that simulates the sea level curve of the past million years with very realistic amplitude modulations, and with good phase modulations.},

	abstract = {The Arctic region is thought to play a key role in unraveling Mesozoic climate evolution. However, Late Cretaceous climate reconstructions in the high latitudes suffer from contradicting paleoclimatic interpretations. Toward the end of the Cretaceous hot-house, atmospheric CO2 concentration declined potentially enabling the formation of sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model to investigate possible effects of different atmospheric CO2 levels and gateway configurations between the North proto-Atlantic Basin and the Arctic Ocean on the formation of Arctic sea-ice in the latest Cretaceous. Sensitivity tests were run with two atmospheric CO2 levels (840 and 1120 ppm, representing 3× and 4× pre-industrial concentrations, respectively) with six paleogeographic configurations. In the experiment with 840 ppm CO2, seasonal Arctic sea-ice is observed in each gateway configuration in December–June, while for 1120 ppm sea-ice in the central Arctic is either limited or absent, depending on gateway configuration. This suggests the existence of a CO2 threshold, estimated between 3× and 4× pre-industrial (PI) CO2 levels. For higher atmospheric CO2 levels sea-ice formation can only occur by the combined effect of cold winds blowing over the Arctic from continental North America during boreal winter and seawater freshening. The latter can be caused by either very limited or an absence of gateway connections between the Arctic and the open ocean. Such a configuration likely developed in the latest Cretaceous, i.e. close to the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary interval.},

The precession equations have also been entirely revised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and Moon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past or into the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Owing to the chaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this time span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For paleoclimate calibrations, we provide several diﬀerent solutions that are all compatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris. We have thus reached the time where geological data are now required to discriminate between planetary orbital solutions beyond 50 Myr.},

	abstract = {Astronomically-forced insolation cycles (“Milankovitch cycles”) serve as a primary control on climate, and when preserved in the stratigraphic record, they provide a high-resolution in situ chronometer. These celestial rhythms derive from the fundamental frequencies of the Solar System, and Earth's precession constant. The fundamental frequencies of Earth and Mars presently define a secular resonance of 2:1 (2.4 Myr to 1.2 Myr), and are hypothesized to have undergone a transition between 50–100 Ma, due to the chaotic behavior of the Solar System. In this study, a 15-Myr long cyclostratigraphic record from the mid-latitude Western Interior Seaway (WIS; spanning 82–97 Ma) is assembled to quantify eccentricity amplitude modulation (AM) and obliquity AM, which could reveal the 2:1 resonance when present. Ten high-precision radioisotopic dates from the study interval permit a rigorous anchoring of the floating astrochronologies for comparison with theoretical astronomical models. The analysis is complimented by the construction of an astronomically tuned δ13Corg composite for the early Cenomanian-early Campanian, which allows a new assessment of linkages between million-year scale astronomical forcing and perturbations of the Late Cretaceous carbon cycle. Evaluation of the La2004 model reveals a switch of eccentricity modulation from 2.4-Myr cycles to a 1.2-Myr cycle from 90 to 86.5 Ma, followed by a return to a 2.4 Myr cycle in younger strata, compatible with observations from the WIS composite. These two resonance transitions are absent in the La2010d and La2011 models. Among 11 solutions calculated by Zeebe (2017), some show resonance transitions during this period, but none of them match the geological record with respect to the observed long eccentricity modulation. The results of this study also suggest that positive carbon isotope excursions are closely related to obliquity power minima, but this interpretation will require further analysis for full confirmation.},

	abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system’s behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980’s. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantiﬁcation of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system’s behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own ﬁeld of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difﬁculties and pitfalls.},

The Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT) is a period of dramatic paleoclimate changes that significantly impacted global ecosystems; however, the influences on plant-herbivore interactions during this period are largely un­ known. We identified taxonomic composition of the flora, and investigated well-preserved herbivore damage on fossil leaves from two layers of the Lawula Formation in Markam County, southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China. Besides, paleoclimate conditions were reconstructed using fossil plant assemblages. The plant assemblage from the latest Eocene layer (MK-3, {\textasciitilde}34.6 Ma) was dominated by Fagaceae and Betulaceae, whereas Rosaceae and Salicaceae were the most abundant in the earliest Oligocene layer (MK-1, {\textasciitilde}33.4 Ma). In MK-3, 932 out of 2428 fossil leaves were damaged and presented 41 damage types (DTs). The richest functional feeding groups (FFGs) in this layer were hole feeding, margin feeding, and galling. In MK-1, 144 out of 599 leaves were damaged and presented 20 DTs, with the major FFGs being hole feeding, margin feeding, and skeletonization. Generally, MK-3 had a significantly higher damage frequency (DF) and more DTs compared to MK-1. The decline in temperature, accompanied by the mountain uplift during the EOT on the QTP margin, led to changes in plant composition, with a consequent decrease in herbivory quantity and diversity. Our results shed new light on the influence of paleoenvironmental changes in shaping the evolution of biodiversity as well as the ecosystem on the plateau.},

The established “partial radiative perturbation” (PRP) method allows an accurate separation of these terms, but requires processing large volumes of model output with an offline version of the model’s radiation code. Here, we propose an “approximate PRP” (APRP) method for the shortwave that provides an accurate estimate of the radiative perturbation, but derived from a quite modest amount of monthly mean model output.},

	abstract = {An Earth system model of intermediate complexity, MoBidiC, has been used to simulate the transient variations in continental temperature, sea-surface temperature (SST), thermohaline circulation (THC) and sea-ice cover over the last 9000 years (9 kyr). Experiments were designed to determine (a) the deviation of the climatic system with respect to equilibrium over the last 9 kyr, (b) the individual contributions of oceans and vegetation to climatic changes, as well as the potential synergies between these components, and (c) the relative importance of precession, obliquity and CO2 concentration changes during this period. Results show a monotonous cooling trend in the northern high latitudes between 9 kyr BP and the present day, both over the oceans and the continents. North of 60°N, this cooling is noticed throughout the year, but the largest variations appear in spring and summer (up to 6 °C over continents). Along with this cooling, the model exhibits a southward shift of the northern treeline by about 600 km. Most of this shift takes place between 4 and 1 kyr BP. During this period, reorganisations of the boreal forest introduce a lag of about 200 years in the system with respect to a state in equilibrium with the external forcing. Sensitivity experiments illustrate the strong impact of this vegetation shift both on the oceans and the continents, especially in spring and early summer. However, the model exhibits a weak synergy between vegetation and ocean throughout the Holocene. Finally, a sensitivity study to the forcing components shows the dominant role of the astronomical forcing with respect to CO2, as well as the non-linear behaviour of climate in response to obliquity and precession.},

	abstract = {The use of pollen analysis to reconstruct regional vegetation changes, and subsequently climate, is a common approach in paleoclimatic reconstruction. However, it is unclear whether or not vegetation exhibits a lagged response to climate change during shifts from rapid cooling to rapid warming. The Younger Dryas (YD) cold event, spanning the last glacial/Holocene transition, was a prominent abrupt climatic event. To investigate the vegetation response to climate change during the YD, we compared proﬁles of independent climatic indicators from the sediments of alpine Lake Gonghai, on the margin of the modern Asian summer monsoon, with a pollen record from the same site. Our aim was to assess the phase lag of vegetation change relative to independent climate proxies that would have responded near instantaneously to climate change. The results show that the vegetation changed synchronously with the climate proxies, and consequently, we conclude that vegetation succession around Lake Gonghai exhibited a nonlagged response to climate change during the YD. This result conﬁrms that a previous pollen-based quantitative regional precipitation record from Lake Gonghai reliably depicts variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), especially its decreasing trend during the YD. This conclusion differs from that of related research on the Baxie loess section and Hani peat deposits. Also, we suggest that our ﬁndings provide an improved understanding of the likely response of the EASM during cooling intervals and that the YD is a useful analog for studying the response of vegetation to possible abrupt cooling events under future global warming scenarios.},

These two components are linked to one another in varying degrees by regions of strong sensible heating (Indo-Asian landmass) and strong latent heat export (the Western Paciﬁc Warm Pool and the southern subtropical Indian Ocean). Variability within the Indian and East Asian subsystems, interactions among them, and the extent to which they interact with other climate phenomena (e.g., ENSO) are current topics of modern and paleoclimate research. This work provides an overview of past and current paleomonsoon research on tectonic to interannual time scales with a primary focus on marine sediment records. While past and current work has contributed greatly to our understanding of paleomonsoon variability at all time scales, additional efforts are required to make further progress in two critical areas. (1) Additional efforts are needed in terms of proxy development and evaluation, requiring concerted efforts at long-term sediment trap deployments in key monsoon-inﬂuenced regions as well as development of adequate and widely available core-top databases. These are necessary to assess the impact of modern oceanographic and seaﬂoor processes on potential monsoon proxies. (2) Additional effort is also needed in acquiring a sufﬁcient geographic distribution of downcore records to assess linkages among the subsystems and their role in the context of extratropical climate change. These records should have high sedimentation rates (including varved sections). This requires substantial survey support to identify the most appropriate coring and drilling targets.},

Our climate simulations show that these differences are present when relief of the Pamir–Tian Shan is higher than 75\% of modern elevation (∼3000 m). Integrated with geological evidence, we suggest that a significant portion of the Pamir–Tian Shan orogen had reached elevations of ∼3 km and acted as a moisture barrier for the westerlies since ca. 25 Ma.},

	abstract = {The timing and mechanisms of the Cretaceous sea incursions into Central Asia are still poorly constrained. We provide a new chronostratigraphic framework based on biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy together with detailed paleoenvironmental analyses of Cretaceous records of the proto‐Paratethys Sea ﬂuctuations in the Tajik and Tarim basins. The Early Cretaceous marine incursion in the western Tajik Basin was followed by major marine incursions during the Cenomanian (ca. 100 Ma) and Santonian (ca. 86 Ma) that reached far into the eastern Tajik and Tarim basins. These marine incursions were separated by a Turonian‐Coniacian (ca. 92–86 Ma) regression. Basin‐wide tectonic subsidence analyses imply that the Early Cretaceous sea incursion into the Tajik Basin was related to increased Pamir tectonism. We ﬁnd that thrusting along the northern edge of the Pamir at ca. 130–90 Ma resulted in increased subsidence in a retro‐arc basin setting. This tectonic event and coeval eustatic highstand resulted in the maximum observed geographic extent of the sea during the Cenomanian (ca. 100 Ma). The following Turonian‐Coniacian (ca. 92–86 Ma) major regression, driven by eustasy, coincides with a sharp slowdown in tectonic subsidence during the late orogenic unloading period with limited thrusting. The Santonian (ca. 86 Ma) major sea incursion was likely controlled by eustasy as evidenced by the coeval ﬂuctuations in the west Siberian Basin. An early Maastrichtian cooling (ca. 71–70 Ma), potentially connected to global Late Cretaceous trends, is inferred from the replacement of mollusk‐rich limestones by bryozoan‐ and echinoderm‐rich limestones.},

	abstract = {The “Green Sahara” is a period when North Africa was characterized by vegetation cover and wetlands. To qualitatively identify the orbital-climatic causation of the Green Sahara regime, we performed dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) simulations, driven by climate forcings from coupled general circulation model (EC-Earth) simulations for the mid-Holocene, in which the vegetation is prescribed to be either modern desert or artiﬁcially vegetated with a reduced dust load. LPJ-GUESS simulates a vegetated Sahara covered by both herbaceous and woody vegetation types consistent with proxy reconstructions only in the latter scenario. Sensitivity experiments identify interactions required to capture the northward extension of vegetation. Increased precipitation is the main driver of the vegetation extent changes, and the temperature anomalies determine the plant functional types mainly through altered ﬁre disturbance. Furthermore, the simulated vegetation composition also depends on the correct representation of soil texture in a humid environment like Green Sahara. Plain Language Summary The Sahara Desert experienced wet and vegetated conditions in the past. The vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks play an important role in sustaining vegetation cover in that region. Here we perform dynamic vegetation model simulations to reproduce herbaceous and woody vegetation types in North Africa 6,000 years ago. We further investigate separately the relative importance of various climate forcings (precipitation, temperature, radiation, and soil temperature) in inducing the “Green Sahara.” We conclude that vegetation extent is mainly determined by precipitation, while vegetation composition is mainly determined by temperature, and the correct representation of soil texture is also important. Future modeling work considering dynamic vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks could be valuable for providing analogues to Sahara/Sahel climate and vegetation regimes in the past and future.},

Based on a sea level deﬁnition, we identify eleven interglacials in the last 800,000 years, a result that is robust to alternative deﬁnitions. Data compilations suggest that despite spatial heterogeneity, Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5e (last interglacial) and 11c ({\textasciitilde}400 ka ago) were globally strong (warm), while MIS 13a ({\textasciitilde}500 ka ago) was cool at many locations. A step change in strength of interglacials at 450 ka is apparent only in atmospheric CO2 and in Antarctic and deep ocean temperature. The onset of an interglacial (glacial termination) seems to require a reducing precession parameter (increasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation), but this condition alone is insufﬁcient. Terminations involve rapid, nonlinear, reactions of ice volume, CO2, and temperature to external astronomical forcing. The precise timing of events may be modulated by millennial-scale climate change that can lead to a contrasting timing of maximum interglacial intensity in each hemisphere. A variety of temporal trends is observed, such that maxima in the main records are observed either early or late in different interglacials. The end of an interglacial (glacial inception) is a slower process involving a global sequence of changes. Interglacials have been typically 10–30 ka long. The combination of minimal reduction in northern summer insolation over the next few orbital cycles, owing to low eccentricity, and high atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations implies that the next glacial inception is many tens of millennia in the future.},

The geological past can provide insights into climate sensitivity; however, on timescales of millions of years, factors other than CO2 can drive climate, including paleogeographic forcing and solar luminosity. Here, through an ensemble of climate model simulations covering the period 150–35 million years ago, we show that climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling varies between ∼3.5 and 5.5 ◦C through this time. These variations can be explained as a nonlinear response to solar luminosity, evolving surface albedo due to changes in ocean area, and changes in ocean circulation. The work shows that the modern climate sensitivity is relatively low in the context of the geological record, as a result of relatively weak feedbacks due to a relatively low CO2 baseline, and the presence of ice and relatively small ocean area in the modern continental configuration.},

These studies concluded to a mean annual temperature of sea surface waters ranging between 21 and 25 °C during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum and to the occurrence of episodic ice on the Arctic shelf in the earliest Mid-Eocene. Pollen records are characterised by excellent preservation and identification of 112 taxa reveals a subtropical coastal vegetation comprising Taxodium-Glyptostrobus swamps alternating with Avicennia mangrove. The hinterland was occupied by a subtropical evergreen forest including Engelhardia and Distylium, occasionally replaced by Rhodoleia and Castanopsis-Lithocarpus. Climate was reconstructed using the Climatic Amplitude Method, resulting in the following temperature ranges for low elevations: mean annual temperature 18–22 °C, mean temperature of the coldest month 10–14.5 °C, mean temperature of the warmest month 26–27.5 °C, and annual precipitation 1150–1400 mm. Palaeovegetation data allow us to establish climatostratigraphic relationships with the generalized oxygen isotope curve, providing evidence for warm periods (e.g.: Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, PETM; Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, EECO; Mid Eocene Climatic Optimum, MECO) alternating with cooler periods. We date the latest record of Avicennia mangrove in the Arctic Basin to the MECO. The Azolla phase did not occur after the EECO but at {\textasciitilde}50 Ma during a climatically unstable episode during the thermal optimum. Recurrence of rarely produced and weakly transported Avicennia pollen, the exceptional level of preservation of pollen grains, and the high plant diversity indicate that lands of the Lomonosov Ridge were connected to North America in the Ellesmere Island region which, in addition, provided pollen grains of Gymnosperms from high elevations. These physiographic features, suggesting the inflow of altitudinal cold waters into the sea, may solve the apparent contradiction between possible sea-ice and our reconstructed air temperatures during the Middle Eocene.},

	abstract = {Pollen data from numerous sites around the Mediterranean Sea indicate that several important vegetation and climatic changes occurred during the Pliocene. These data are in good agreement with pollen records from northwest Europe and with Ž18O curves from Mediterranean and Atlantic deep-sea cores. Quantitative palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Pliocene pollen data of the Mediterranean region cannot be based on conventional modern analogue techniques, as individual Pliocene pollen spectra contain taxa representing temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical plants that do not grow together today. Instead, we propose a new method that uses a climatic amplitude method modiﬁed to take partially into account the relative abundances of the taxa. We applied this method to the Pliocene Garraf 1 palynological sequence from Catalonia, which provides a long continuous record of climatic change from 5.3 Ma to the Early Pleistocene. We estimate that annual temperatures were 1 to 5ºC higher than today and the annual precipitation 400 to 1000 mm higher than today prior to the beginning of the late Cenozoic glacial–interglacial cycles. In contrast, temperature and precipitation both fell sharply during the glacial phases of the earliest glacial–interglacial cycles. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Pollen analysis of Miocene and Pliocene sediments from the Iberian Peninsula shows a progressive reduction in plant diversity through time caused by the disappearance of thermophilous and high-water requirement plants. In addition, an increase in warm–temperate (mesothermic), seasonal-adapted “Mediterranean” taxa, high-elevation conifers and herbs (mainly Artemisia) occurred during the Middle and Late Miocene and Pliocene. This has mainly been interpreted as a response of the vegetation to global and regional processes, including climate cooling related to the development of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and then the onset of the Arctic Ice Sheet, uplift of regional mountains related to the Alpine uplift and the progressive movement of Eurasia towards northern latitudes as a result of the northwards subduction of Africa. The development of steppe-like vegetation in southern Iberia is ancient and probably started during the Oligocene. The onset of a contrasted seasonality in temperature during the Mid-Pliocene superimposed on the pre-existing seasonality in precipitation, the annual length of which increased southward. The Mediterranean climatic rhythm (summer drought) began about 3.4 Ma and caused the individualization of modern Mediterranean ecosystems. Quaternary-type Mediterranean climatic ﬂuctuations started at 2.6 Ma (Gelasian) resulting in repeated steppe vs. forest alternations. A latitudinal climatic gradient between the southern and the northern parts of the Iberian Peninsula existed since the Middle Miocene.},

	abstract = {Pollen analysis of a Lower Miocene succession from the Rubielos de Mora Basin (NE Spain) has been carried out with the aim of reconstructing the flora, vegetation and climatic changes. Previous paleobotanical studies on these sedimentary rocks and adjacent areas interpreted very diverse climates for the Early Miocene: from humid temperate to dry subtropical. In this study, a rich thermophilous pollen spectrum and a diverse subarid flora including Nitraria, Caesalpiniaceae, Ephedra and Acacia, indicative of a dry subtropical climate are identified. On the other hand, mesothermic taxa with high water requirements are also abundant. Therefore, the pollen assemblages evidence the juxtaposition of very contrasted environments: the presence of subdesertic taxa, typical of plants growing in the lowlands and conditioned by a long warm, dry season, together with others with very high water requirements, needing constant water. This can be explained by the presence of the Rubielos de Mora Lake providing local conditions for developing riparian forests. The vegetation was clearly controlled by the water availability under a subtropical and dry-seasonal climate. Pollen changes along the succession, which coincide with sedimentological changes, are related to climatic variations. Alternation in pollen taxa (thermophilous–dry vs. mesothermic–riparian) reflects the influence of the cyclicity of temperature and precipitation on the lake level and vegetation.},

	abstract = {The climatic reconstruction of the Pliocene, based on pollen data, requires a new method of quantification because of the presence in pollen spectra, of temperate, warm-temperate but also subtropical plants. As no modern pollen spectra contain all these taxa, the best analogues method is inappropriate for this period. So, a new method is proposed: it corresponds to a climatic amplitude method modified to partially take into account some taxa abundances. The first step in this new method is to determine the present-day distribution of a few subtropical plants and some taxa still existing in the Mediterranean region with a good climatic signal. Then, the climatic parameters of the corresponding areas are defined, either by a climatic atlas or by personal knowledge. A test on a few pollen spectra, corresponding to different localities but of almost the same age (about 3.4 Ma) is realised. The first results of climatic estimation confirm an increasing latitudinal gradient for annual temperatures from North to South, which is estimated as today, even if the temperatures were higher (about 2 to 6°C more). We may confirm the same for the precipitations which were more important to the North than to the South of the Mediterranean. These latitudinal gradients are quantified.},

	abstract = {The biodiversity of the Himalaya, Hengduan Mountains and Tibet, here collectively termed the Tibetan Region, is exceptional in a global context. To contextualize and understand the origins of this biotic richness, and its conservation value, we examine recent fossil ﬁnds and review progress in understanding the orogeny of the Tibetan Region. We examine the deep-time origins of monsoons affecting Asia, climate variation over different timescales, and the establishment of environmental niche heterogeneity linked to topographic development. The origins of the modern biodiversity were established in the Eocene, concurrent with the formation of pronounced topographic relief across the Tibetan Region. High ({\textgreater}4 km) mountains to the north and south of what is now the Tibetan Plateau bounded a Paleogene central lowland ({\textless}2.5 km) hosting moist subtropical vegetation inﬂuenced by an intensifying monsoon. In mid Miocene times, before the Himalaya reached their current elevation, sediment inﬁlling and compressional tectonics raised the ﬂoor of the central valley to above 3000 m, but central Tibet was still moist enough, and low enough, to host a warm temperate angiosperm-dominated woodland. After 15 Ma, global cooling, the further rise of central Tibet, and the rain shadow cast by the growing Himalaya, progressively led to more open, herb-rich vegetation as the modern high plateau formed with its cool, dry climate. In the moist monsoonal Hengduan Mountains, high and spatially extensive since the Eocene but subsequently deeply dissected by river incision, Neogene cooling depressed the tree line, compressed altitudinal zonation, and created strong environmental heterogeneity. This served as a cradle for the then newly-evolving alpine biota and favoured diversity within more thermophilic vegetation at lower elevations. This diversity has survived through a combination of minimal Quaternary glaciation, and complex relief-related environmental niche heterogeneity. The great antiquity and diversity of the Tibetan Region biota argues for its conservation, and the importance of that biota is demonstrated through our insights into its long temporal gestation provided by fossil archives and information written in surviving genomes. These data sources are worthy of conservation in their own right, but for the living biotic inventory we need to ask what it is we want to conserve. Is it 1) individual taxa for their intrinsic properties, 2) their services in functioning ecosystems, or 3) their capacity to generate future new biodiversity? If 2 or 3 are our goal then landscape conservation at scale is required, and not just seed banks or botanical/zoological gardens.},

	abstract = {The climatic impacts of the Tibetan Plateau since the Neogene and the phytogeographic pattern changes of formerly widely‐distributed forest communities on the plateau remain poorly constrained. Today, Cercis L. (Fabaceae) is a well‐known arborescent genus typically distributed in subtropical to warm temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, and Paleogene fossil occurrences from Eurasia and North America show a long history of the genus in mid‐low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we describe a fossil species, Cercis zekuensis sp. nov. based on well‐preserved fruits from the early Miocene of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Detailed morphological comparison (e.g., ventral margin with a veinless wing) of extant and fossil members of Cercis and other genera conﬁrmed validity of the present taxonomic identity. Based on the comparison with extant relatives and their climate preferences, this unexpected occurrence of thermophilic Cercis in northeastern Tibetan Plateau indicates this area had higher temperature and precipitation in the Miocene than today. Integrated with inferred (paleo‐)temperature lapse rates, this indicates a low paleoelevation of less than 2.4 km. In contrast with the present‐day alpine climate here ({\textasciitilde}3.7 km), such a low elevation facilitated a more favorable habitat with comparatively high biodiversity and warm temperate forests at that time, as were evidenced by co‐occurring megafossils. Moreover, the present existence of Cercis implies the genus was widespread in interior Asia during the early Neogene and shows its modern disjunction or diversiﬁcation between eastern and central Asia was possibly shaped by the late Cenozoic regional tectonic uplift and consequential environmental deterioration.},

	abstract = {Present-day Asia comprises a heterogeneous collage of continental blocks, derived from the Indian–west Australian margin of eastern Gondwana, and subduction related volcanic arcs assembled by the closure of multiple Tethyan and back-arc ocean basins now represented by suture zones containing ophiolites, accretionary complexes and remnants of ocean island arcs. The Phanerozoic evolution of the region is the result of more than 400 million years of continental dispersion from Gondwana and plate tectonic convergence, collision and accretion. This involved successive dispersion of continental blocks, the northwards translation of these, and their amalgamation and accretion to form present-day Asia. Separation and northwards migration of the various continental terranes/blocks from Gondwana occurred in three phases linked with the successive opening and closure of three intervening Tethyan oceans, the Palaeo-Tethys (Devonian–Triassic), Meso-Tethys (late Early Permian–Late Cretaceous) and Ceno-Tethys (Late Triassic–Late Cretaceous). The ﬁrst group of continental blocks dispersed from Gondwana in the Devonian, opening the Palaeo-Tethys behind them, and included the North China, Tarim, South China and Indochina blocks (including West Sumatra and West Burma). Remnants of the main Palaeo-Tethys ocean are now preserved within the Longmu Co-Shuanghu, Changning–Menglian, Chiang Mai/Inthanon and Bentong–Raub Suture Zones. During northwards subduction of the Palaeo-Tethys, the Sukhothai Arc was constructed on the margin of South China–Indochina and separated from those terranes by a short-lived back-arc basin now represented by the Jinghong, Nan–Uttaradit and Sra Kaeo Sutures. Concurrently, a second continental sliver or collage of blocks (Cimmerian continent) rifted and separated from northern Gondwana and the Meso-Tethys opened in the late Early Permian between these separating blocks and Gondwana. The eastern Cimmerian continent, including the South Qiangtang block and Sibumasu Terrane (including the Baoshan and Tengchong blocks of Yunnan) collided with the Sukhothai Arc and South China/Indochina in the Triassic, closing the Palaeo-Tethys. A third collage of continental blocks, including the Lhasa block, South West Borneo and East Java–West Sulawesi (now identiﬁed as the missing ‘‘Banda’’ and ‘‘Argoland’’ blocks) separated from NW Australia in the Late Triassic–Late Jurassic by opening of the Ceno-Tethys and accreted to SE Sundaland by subduction of the Meso-Tethys in the Cretaceous.},

Here, we ­present carbonate carbon isotope and grain-size records from the Tarim Basin, western China, revealing a detailed desertification history for the Taklimakan Desert. Our records demonstrate that after desiccation of episodic lakes at ca. 4.9 Ma, alternations of eolian sand dunes and fluvial and playa-like conditions persisted for a long period until 0.7 Ma in the Tarim Basin. The onset of permanent desert landscape around 0.7–0.5 Ma occurred concurrently with the climatic reorganization across the mid-Pleistocene transition. The occurrence of mountain glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and atmospheric circulation changes may have controlled the formation and extreme aridification of the permanent desert in inland Asia since the mid-Pleistocene transition.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the framework for comparing independent study means (SMs) with averages of aggregated study mean paleomagnetic poles, hereafter referred to as reference poles, contributing to continental or global apparent polar wander paths (GAPWP). Paleomagnetists typically compare individual SMs to these population means to compute latitudinal displacements or rotations with uncertainties estimated by comparing A95's. Using this comparison statistic, more than half of the population of reference SMs contributing to a GAPWP fall at an angular distance that is greater than their combined uncertainties. Two approaches are presented that yield similar results based on different rationales and comparison statistics. Common to both approaches is K95,GAPWP, the angular distance within which 95\% of poles contributing to an APWP mean fall. One approach combines K95,GAPWP and the A95,SM of the independent study mean that can only be judged to be signiﬁcantly displaced if the angular difference with the GAPWP mean exceeds their combined uncertainty. The second approach uses K95,GAPWP as the best estimate of total error of each study mean, which when combined with uncertainty of the GAPWP mean, A95,GAPWP, deﬁnes the angular difference that the independent study mean needs to exceed to be judged to be signiﬁcantly displaced from a GAPWP mean. These comparison statistics are used to assess paleomagnetic support for Greater Indian Basin hypothesis for the paleogeographic evolution of the northern margin of India prior to collision with Asia. The Greater Indian Basin hypothesis is not supported based on these more rigorous criteria.},

	abstract = {Key in understanding the geodynamics governing subduction and orogeny is reconstructing the paleogeography of ‘Greater India’, the Indian plate lithosphere that subducted since Tethyan Himalayan continental collision with Asia. Here, we discuss this reconstruction from paleogeographic, kinematic, and geodynamic perspectives and isolate the evolution scenario that is consistent with all three. We follow recent constraints advocating a {\textasciitilde}58 Ma initial collision and update a previous kinematic restoration of intra-Asian shortening with a recently proposed model that reconciles long-debated large and small estimates of Indochina extrusion. Our new reconstruction is tested against paleomagnetic data, and against seismic tomographic constraints on paleo-subduction zone locations. The resulting restoration shows {\textasciitilde}1000–1200 km of post-collisional intra-Asian shortening, leaving a 2600–3400 km wide Greater India. From a paleogeographic, sediment provenance perspective, Eocene sediments in the Lesser Himalaya and on undeformed India may be derived from Tibet, suggesting that all Greater Indian lithosphere was continental, but may alternatively be sourced from the contemporaneous western Indian orogen unrelated to India-Asia collision. A quantitative kinematic, paleomagnetic perspective prefers major Cretaceous extension and a ‘Greater India Basin’ opening within Greater India, but data uncertainty may speculatively allow for minimal extension. Finally, from a geodynamic perspective, assuming a fully continental Greater India would require that subduction rates close to 20 cm/yr was driven by a downgoing lithosphere-crust assemblage more buoyant than the mantle, which seems physically improbable. We conclude that the Greater India Basin scenario is the only sustainable one from all three perspectives. We infer that old pre-collisional lithosphere rapidly entered the lower mantle sustaining high subduction rates, whilst post-collisional continental and young Greater India basin lithosphere did not, inciting the rapid India-Asia convergence deceleration {\textasciitilde}8 Myr after collision. Subsequent absolute northward slab migration and overturning caused ﬂat slab subduction, Tibetan shortening, arc migration and arc volume decrease.},

	abstract = {The extended northern continental margin of Africa is currently colliding with and under-thrusting northward below Cyprus. The age of onset of this collision is poorly constrained, but is critical if we are to quantify continental subduction and evaluate its role during spectacular recent uplift of southern Turkey from {\textasciitilde}7 Ma to the present. Here, we reevaluate the evolution of northern Cyprus and document the modern structure of the Kyrenia foldthrust belt in a balanced cross section for the ﬁrst time, to determine the timing and amount of shortening. The belt deformed an Upper Cretaceous to Miocene stratigraphy, which was deposited onto a metamorphic basement. The fold-thrust belt was previously proposed to have formed during two stages: in Eocene and late Miocene time, based on stratigraphic and limited structural evidence. We revaluate evidence for an Eocene phase of thrusting in Kyrenia and ﬁnd that 1) repetitions of Eocene and older rocks are explained by Miocene thrusting, and newly documented olistoliths were misinterpreted as pre-Miocene thrust slices 2) uplift in Eocene time was not isolated to Kyrenia but also affected northern Arabia and results from regional dynamic topography or forebulge formation. Based on kinematic constraints from a plate reconstruction, we interpret that metamorphic rocks in Kyrenia were metamorphosed by Cretaceous burial below the Troodos ophiolite and were subsequently exhumed by upper plate extension during latest Cretaceous obduction onto the African margin. The latest Cretaceous-Miocene plate boundary between Africa and the Taurides was located to the north of Kyrenia. The Kyrenia fold-thrust belt accommodated a minimum of 17.5 km of shortening as a result of {\textasciitilde}9–6 Ma thrusting as a result of initial Africa-Taurides collision. The northern edge of African continental crust arrived below the Taurides, where it has been seismologically imaged, in late Pleistocene time and may have caused or contributed to recently recognised major Tauride uplift since {\textasciitilde}0.5 Ma.},

	abstract = {The basins and orogens of the Mediterranean region ultimately result from the opening of oceans during the early break-up of Pangea since the Triassic, and their subsequent destruction by subduction accommodating convergence between the African and Eurasian Plates since the Jurassic. The region has been the cradle for the development of geodynamic concepts that link crustal evolution to continental break-up, oceanic and continental subduction, and mantle dynamics in general. The development of such concepts requires a ﬁrst-order understanding of the kinematic evolution of the region for which a multitude of reconstructions have previously been proposed. In this paper, we use advances made in kinematic restoration software in the last decade with a systematic reconstruction protocol for developing a more quantitative restoration of the Mediterranean region for the last 240 million years. This restoration is constructed for the ﬁrst time with the GPlates plate reconstruction software and uses a systematic reconstruction protocol that limits input data to marine magnetic anomaly reconstructions of ocean basins, structural geological constraints quantifying timing, direction, and magnitude of tectonic motion, and tests and iterations against paleomagnetic data. This approach leads to a reconstruction that is reproducible, and updatable with future constraints. We ﬁrst review constraints on the opening history of the Atlantic (and Red Sea) oceans and the Bay of Biscay. We then provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture of the Mediterranean orogens, from the Pyrenees and Betic-Rif orogen in the west to the Caucasus in the east and identify structural geological constraints on tectonic motions. We subsequently analyze a newly constructed database of some 2300 published paleomagnetic sites from the Mediterranean region and test the reconstruction against these constraints. We provide the reconstruction in the form of 12 maps being snapshots from 240 to 0 Ma, outline the main features in each time-slice, and identify differences from previous reconstructions, which are discussed in the ﬁnal section.},

	abstract = {Tomographic imaging of the mantle under Tibet, India and the adjacent Indian Ocean reveals several zones of relatively high P-wave velocities at various depths. Under the Hindu Kush region in northeastern Afghanistan and southern Tajikistan, a regional northward-dipping slab is seen in the entire upper 600 km of the mantle and is apparently still attached to the lithosphere of the Indian plate. Under northern Pakistan this same slab shows a roll-over structure with the deeper portion overturned and dipping southward, as can also be seen in the distribution of earthquake hypocenters. Farther east-southeast (e.g., in the vicinity of Nepal), a well-resolved anomaly below 450 km depth is connected to the slab under the Hindu Kush, but seems to be separated from the lithosphere above 350 km. These upper-mantle anomalies are interpreted as the remnants of delaminated sub-continental lithosphere that went down when Greater India continued to converge northward with Asia after ¾45 Ma. The deeper high-velocity anomalies under the Indian sub-continent appear clearly separated from the shallower ones as well as from each other, and are inferred to represent remnants of oceanic lithospheric slabs that have sunk into the lower mantle and were subsequently overridden by the Indian plate. They occur at depths between 1000 and 2300 km and occasionally descend down to the core–mantle boundary. The anomalies form three parallel WNW–ESE striking zones. We interpret the two southern zones as remnants of oceanic lithosphere that was subducted when the Neo-Tethys Ocean closed between India and Tibet in the Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary. The northern deep-mantle zone under northern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Lhasa block in southern Tibet may represent the last-subducted remnant of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, which is thought to have closed before the Hauterivian stage of the Early Cretaceous. The middle zone continues southeastward as a rather straight high-velocity zone towards Sumatra, where it becomes convex southward and parallel to the subduction zone under the Sunda arc. Comparison of this straight middle zone near India with the shallower (upper 600–1000 km) northern zone, which displays a cusp-like shape near the Yunnan (SW China) Syntaxis of the eastern Himalayas, supports the notion that the shallow northern zone represents later subduction than the deeper middle zone. The suggestion of a counterclockwise rotation ({\textgreater}20º) of the Indian plate during Tertiary indentation of Asia is supported by these features. The present-day latitudes of 5º–35ºN of the deep slabs under India and adjacent areas correspond to the approximate paleolatitudes of the Cretaceous subduction zones. The slab remnants in the middle mantle occur therefore near the ancient locations where they started their downward journey, which implies that lateral movements in the deeper mantle were not large. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Continental crust is buoyant compared with its oceanic counterpart and resists subduction into the mantle. When two continents collide, the mass balance for the continental crust is therefore assumed to be maintained. Here we use estimates of pre-collisional crustal thickness and convergence history derived from plate kinematic models to calculate the crustal mass balance in the India–Asia collisional system. Using the current best estimates for the timing of the diachronous onset of collision between India and Eurasia, we find that about 50\% of the pre-collisional continental crustal mass cannot be accounted for in the crustal reservoir preserved at Earth’s surface today—represented by the mass preserved in the thickened crust that makes up the Himalaya, Tibet and much of adjacent Asia, as well as southeast Asian tectonic escape and exported eroded sediments. This implies large-scale subduction of continental crust during the collision, with a mass equivalent to about 15\% of the total oceanic crustal subduction flux since 56 million years ago. We suggest that similar contamination of the mantle by direct input of radiogenic continental crustal materials during past continent–continent collisions is reflected in some ocean crust and ocean island basalt geochemistry. The subduction of continental crust may therefore contribute significantly to the evolution of mantle geochemistry.},

	abstract = {On the basis of a synthesis of tectonic data available on the India-Asia collision, we present a first attempt to reconstruct the evolution of the collision zone. Assuming that the deformation of the lithosphere is localized along narrow shear zones and that the interiors of mantle blocks in between remain relatively undeformed, we define block contours from the fault pattern and move back the blocks along their boundary faults. Along convergent or extensional boundaries, the crust is assumed to shorten or stretch coherently. Step-by-step, we go backward in time to finally reach the collision onset. For each time step, we find a solution compatible with the data set available and the position of the adjacent blocks for each block. The search for compatibility at the scale of the entire collision zone allows for solving the kinematics of regions with fewer data and suggests plausible scenarios for regions where data is lacking. For each step, we calculate large-scale displacement maps, and determine Euler poles for each block. For the most recent time step, the map proposed is compared to GPS motions. The deformation budget implies that extrusion absorbed ∼30\% of the convergence between India and Siberia during the entire collision span, but varied with time, accounting for as little as 3\% or as much as 60\% of this convergence at different epochs.},

	abstract = {The Cretaceous–early Tertiary Gangdese arc in southern Tibet is generally attributed to the northward subduction of Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere prior to Indo-Asian collision. However, the history and tectonic significance of deformation and sedimentation in Tibet during this time interval have remained enigmatic. We show that contractional structures and clastic rocks near the city of Lhasa can be attributed to the development of a northward-propagating retroarc thrust belt that was active between 105 and 53 Ma. A kinematic model shows that the thrust belt could have accommodated {\textgreater}230 km ({\textgreater}55\%) of N-S shortening. An episode of large magnitude ({\textgreater}160 km) and rapid ({\textgreater}8 mm/yr) shortening predated the onset of a magmatic flare-up ca. 69 Ma, which is linked to removal of overthickened mantle lithosphere. This tectonic history implies that southern Tibet underwent substantial crustal thickening and elevation gain prior to the Indo-Asian collision.},

	abstract = {The Trans-Himalayan magmatism, which occurred extensively in the Lhasa terrane of southern Tibet, has long been related to the Neotethyan subduction before the India–Asia collision. To better delineate the magmatic duration, we report a geochronological study with 25 SHRIMP zircon U–Pb ages from the Gangdese Batholith that represents the largest Trans-Himalayan plutonic complex. The results suggest two distinct stages of plutonism in the Late Cretaceous (ca. 103–80 Ma) and early Paleogene (ca. 65–46 Ma), respectively. Our new data confirm if not refine the notion that a Gangdese magmatic gap or quiescent period existed between ca. 80 and 70 Ma. It is furthermore identified that the early stage ended with adakitic intrusion and the latter stage is marked by a peak activity at ca. 50 Ma. We attribute the cessation of the early stage, and following magmatic gap, to a flattening of the northward Neotethyan subduction, and the initiation of the latter stage to rollback of the subducted slab. The proposed scenarios can also account for the southward migration and intensification of Cretaceous to Paleogene volcanism in the Lhasa terrane that demonstrates a coeval, eruptive “flare-up” event around 50 Ma, interpreted as the result of detaching the Neotethyan oceanic slab from the adherent, more buoyant Indian continental lithosphere owing to the India–Asia collision. Our model is, moreover, in general accord with sedimentary and structural geologic records from southern Tibet where subduction-related orogenesis appears to have evolved through time before India started colliding Asia.},

	abstract = {The timing of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau remains controversial, with estimates varying from Eocene to more recent than Pliocene. In particular, the paleoaltimetry of the Qiangtang terrane, on the central Tibetan Plateau, is completely unknown. Here, we present new stable isotope results of fluvial/lacustrine carbonate cement, pedogenic carbonate and marl from the Kangtuo and Suonahu formations deposited between ∼51 and ∼28Ma in the Heihuling–Bamaoqiongzong area of the northern Qiangtang terrane. The lithofacies associations indicate that the Kangtuo formation was deposited in alluvial fan and fluvial floodplain environments, and the Suonahu formation was deposited in near shore lacustrine, playa-lake and channelized fluvial environments. Carbon and oxygen isotope values, coupled with the sedimentary facies interpretations, point to evaporation and low respiration rates in the Eocene–Oligocene paleosols, suggesting an arid climate in the high Qiangtang area at the time. The δ18Opsw values of paleo-surface water reconstructed from the lowest (i.e. the least evaporated) δ18Oc (PDB) values of the unaltered authigenic carbonates are used to make the minimum estimates of the average paleoelevation of the drainage basin. The paleoelevation of the northern Qiangtang terrane is reconstructed as above 5000m by at least the middle Oligocene (28Ma), similar to the present elevation in this area. The aridity and the positive shift in oxygen isotope values of surface waters in our study area may suggest that the high Lhasa terrane established by the middle Oligocene blocked the northward transport of tropical moisture. Maintenance of high elevation ({\textgreater}5000m) from at least the Oligocene to the present suggests that the Qiangtang crust was already thickened by that time, and that underthrusting of India beneath Asia since then has continued to provide additional material while at the same time driving Asian lower crust eastward by crustal flow.},

	abstract = {The N18O value of meteoric water varies with elevation, providing a means to reconstruct paleoelevation if the N18O values of paleowater are known. In this study, we determined the N18O values of water (N18Omw) from small tributaries along the Seti River and Kali Gandaki in the Nepal Himalaya. We found that N18Omw values decrease with increasing altitude for both transects. N18Omw vs. altitude along the Kali Gandaki in west-central Nepal fit a second order polynomial curve, consistent with increasing depletion of 18O with increasing elevation, as predicted by a Rayleigh-type fractionation process. This modern N18Omw vs. altitude relationship can be used to constrain paleoelevation from the N18O values of Miocene{\textasciicircum}Pliocene carbonate (N18Oc) deposited in the Thakkhola graben in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Paleoelevations of 3800 þ 480 m to 5900 þ 350 are predicted for the older Tetang Formation and 4500 þ 430 m to 6300 þ 330 m for the younger Thakkhola Formation.

Oxygen isotope compositions of bivalve shell, paleosol, and lacustrine carbonates indicate the preservation of unaltered isotopic signals of paleometeoric waters in the Kailas and Qiabulin areas, whereas the oxygen isotopic compositions of Liuqu Eocene paleosols were likely altered by paleometeoric waters. Paleoelevation estimates using oxygen isotopes indicate the Kailas area was at {\textasciitilde}4.9 km during {\textasciitilde}20–19 Ma and the Qiabulin Basin was at {\textasciitilde}2.0 km during 24–21 Ma, but rose rapidly to {\textasciitilde}4.1 km between 21 and 19 Ma. These results suggest a steep south-facing ﬂank on the proto-Tibetan highland prior to the onset of the India-Asia collision. The Himalayan orogen began to be built against the pre-existed high ({\textasciitilde}4.5 km) Gangdese Mountains in the early Eocene and obtained elevations close to those of the present by the early Miocene. We propose that the southernmost Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan orogen are the expression of an early Eocene to early Miocene southward migration of the locus of deformation. Early stage uplift is linked to the crustal thickening in the early Eocene, but the dramatic elevation gain in the early Miocene may have been caused by Indian slab rollback, break-off and coeval renewed underthrusting, behind which late Miocene to present east-west crustal extension took place.},

	abstract = {The Tajik Basin is now located to the west of the Pamirs, but it formerly connected with the Tarim Basin, occupied by a large epicontinental sea (proto-Paratethys Sea) once extended from Europe to Central Asia. However, the northward indentation and collision of the Pamirs into the Tian Shan separated the Tajik and Tarim Basins, creating manifold implications and consequences. Consequently, timing of the final seawater retreat from the Tajik Basin is important for understanding the evolution of the proto-Paratethys Sea, the effect of the northward indentation of the Pamirs on the sea regression, and the influence of seawater retreat on the Cenozoic aridification in the Tajik Basin. Here we present a multidisciplinary study of Upper Paleogene strata from the central Tajik Basin. Our results demonstrate that the final seawater retreat from the center of the Tajik Basin occurred at 38.6 Ma, which is earlier than a previous age of 37.4 Ma from the northeastern Tajik Basin. Such a late Eocene sea retreat was quasi-simultaneous with that in the Tarim Basin. This final marine regression was mainly a consequence of the northward indentation and growth of the Pamirs, which was an intracontinental response to the India-Asia collision. Our new detrital zircon ages indicate that the provenance of Upper Eocene-lower Oligocene strata was from the Pamirs rather than Tian Shan, implying that the reactivation of the Tian Shan was later than the early Oligocene. Our paleomagnetic data indicate a 30° counterclockwise rotation of the central Tajik Basin that is much bigger than the previous estimate of 17°, and we propose that such a counterclockwise rotation mostly occurred after the late Miocene. Finally, different from the previous reported aridfication at 39 Ma or 37 Ma, our evidence demonstrates that drought intensified since the start of the Oligocene at 34 Ma, being related to reduced water vapor transport to Central Asia, caused by global cooling-induced sea-level drop, the retreating Paratethys Sea, and weakened sea surface evaporation.},

	abstract = {We present a minimal spatial model of vegetation carbon, soil carbon and soil water storage and the exchange of energy, water and carbon with the atmosphere. The efficient numerical terrestrial scheme (ENTS) is designed for long time period simulations and large ensemble studies in Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs). ENTS includes new parameterisations of vegetation fractional cover and roughness length as functions of vegetation carbon, and a relationship between soil carbon storage and soil water holding capacity. We make and justify the approximation that when the solar forcing is a diurnal average, as in our EMIC, the land radiation balance equilibrates with the atmosphere within a few days. This allows us to solve directly for equilibrium land temperature, making ENTS very computationally efficient and avoiding problems of numerical instability that beset many land surface schemes. We tune the carbon cycle parameters towards observed values of global carbon storage in vegetation and soil and estimated global fluxes of net photosynthesis, vegetation respiration, leaf litter and soil respiration. When the model is forced with long term monthly mean fields of NCEP reanalysis climate data, we find ENTS yields broadly accurate patterns of vegetation and soil carbon storage, vegetation fraction, surface albedo, land temperature and evaporation.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the sedimentology and paleobotany of a Late Oligocene (27.36 ± 0.11 Ma) succession of volcaniclastic strata from the Margargaria River region, northwestern Ethiopian Plateau. Sedimentology indicates fluvial deposition of clay- and silt-rich strata during the early sedimentary phases, whereas organic-rich deposits and massive and fluvially-reworked ash layers are increasingly more common in the middle and upper parts of the succession, respectively. Periods of interrupted deposition are indicated by three paleosol types present in the basal and middle parts of the succession. Paleobotany documents an exclusively angiosperm flora typical of riparian environments in the lower parts of the succession, and a flora dominated by ferns and a few angiosperm taxa typical of disturbed environments in the middle and upper parts. Sedimentology and paleobotany, combined, indicate a riparian environment inhabited by angiosperms for the lower part of the succession, characterized by rather calm deposition by meandering streams. The middle and upper parts of the succession represent transient environments colonized by pioneer vegetation consisting of a diverse fern community and fewer pioneer angiosperms, characterized by deposition of organic- and ash-rich strata in situ in ephemeral ponds and by small-scale crevasse-like channels and by aereal means on the landscape, respectively. Physiographic changes are interpreted to have resulted directly from the influence of volcanism on the surface environment. In summary, this study shows that the volcanic activity associated with the elevation of the northwestern Ethiopian Plateau during the Oligocene repeatedly influenced the development of plant communities and paleoenvironments, favoring the succession of heterogeneous ecosystems on short temporal and spatial scales. Finally, this study is the first that combines paleobotanical and sedimentological data for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and understanding of plant community dynamics in Paleogene deposits from Africa, and it demonstrates the advantages of a multiproxy approach for assessment of paleoecosystem dynamics on an unstable landscape.},

Temperature and precipitation are expressed as simple functions of the past trajectory of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and a statistical model is ﬁt using a limited set of training runs. The approach is demonstrated to be a useful and computationally efﬁcient alternative to pattern scaling and captures the nonlinear evolution of spatial patterns of climate anomalies inherent in transient climates. The approach does as well as pattern scaling in all circumstances and substantially better in many; it is not computationally demanding; and, once the statistical model is ﬁt, it produces emulated climate output effectively instantaneously. It may therefore ﬁnd wide application in climate impacts assessments and other policy analyses requiring rapid climate projections.},

	abstract = {Understanding conditions at both global and local scales during the greenhouse climate of the Eocene Epoch is critical for making accurate predictions in our rapidly warming world. Despite the wealth of proxy data and modeling studies, fundamental aspects of the climate system still remain uncertain. For example, accurate austral high‐latitude temperatures are necessary to understand the evolution of temperatures during the lead‐up to Antarctic glaciation and determine the meridional temperature gradient during greenhouse warmth, yet records are few and disparate. Here we present seasonally resolved temperature and precipitation data from the latest Lutetian ({\textasciitilde}42 Ma) from the eastern Antarctic Peninsula. Oxygen isotopes from bivalves indicate a mean temperature of 13.1 °C and a seasonal range of 8.0 °C, slightly ({\textless}1 °C) more seasonal than modeled temperatures from high‐obliquity simulations. Carbon isotopes from driftwood suggest that summer accounts for just over half of annual precipitation. When compared with other austral high‐latitude records, the data are consistent with a zonally heterogeneous middle Eocene Southern Ocean. Similar longitudinal variability is observed in the modern boreal high latitudes, where landmasses subdivide the ocean, subjecting basins to their own distinct circulation patterns and coastal processes. With closed Drake and Tasman passages, the middle Eocene Southern Ocean would also have been noncontiguous, resulting in larger variability of sea surface temperatures along individual zonal bands than today. This interpretation resolves inconsistencies among existing high‐austral proxy records and suggests that the large seasonal range of temperatures may be indicative of regional‐scale circulation patterns along the peninsula not captured by low‐resolution climate simulations.},

	abstract = {Efforts to estimate past global mean temperature and latitudinal gradients must contend with spatial heterogeneity in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Here, we use modern SSTs to show that the environments from which most paleoclimatic data are drawn, shallow epeiric seas and continental margins, are systematically offset from zonal mean temperatures. Epeiric seas are warmer and more seasonal than open‐ocean values from the same latitudes, while continental margins exhibit consistent and predictable deviations related to gyre circulation. Warm temperatures inferred from Paleozoic proxy data may largely reﬂect that these data derive almost entirely from epeiric seas. Moreover, pseudoproxy analysis using Paleogene sampling localities demonstrates how undersampling of the full range of dynamical environments associated with gyre circulation can generate spurious estimates of latitudinal temperature gradients. Recognition of these global patterns permits a predictive framework within which to more robustly interpret proxy data, improve Earth system models, and reconstruct ancient dynamic regimes. Plain Language Summary Geochemical analyses provide estimates of past sea surface temperature. These data are integral to calculating global climate metrics, such as the latitudinal temperature gradient. For myriad reasons, the sites of these data are not evenly distributed across the global oceans but, instead, are biased toward two environments—continental margins and shallow continental seas. It is therefore important to determine the extent to which theses environments reﬂect broader climatic conditions. We use global ocean data to demonstrate that modern shallow, restricted seas are consistently warmer and more seasonal than anticipated for their given latitude. Because all sea surface temperature data older than {\textasciitilde}200 Ma come from these environments, this observation could help explain why many Paleozoic temperatures appear unrealistically hot. Similarly, nearshore environments exhibit consistent offsets from the open ocean, both in terms of annual temperature and seasonal range, depending on their position within a gyre. This observation helps explain some of the longitudinal heterogeneity in paleoclimate data and should be used to inform locations to target for future data collection. Ignoring environment‐speciﬁc patterns can lead to spurious estimates of global climate metrics. However, cognizance of and correction for sampling location biases can improve interpretations of ancient climates.},

The new discovery enriches the knowledge of the paleo-diversity of the Equisetum and indicates that the sphenophytes once existed in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Based on the fossil records in and around the Tibetan Plateau, Equisetum could survive at a higher latitude during the Palaeogene and they could only grow in lower latitude since the Neogene, which might be the result of the tectonic deformation and climatic changes in the northern plateau since the Miocene.

Previous elevations estimated from stable isotope records from the Lunpola Basin in central Tibet, which indicate a high plateau since at least 35 Ma, are challenged by recent discoveries of low-elevation tropical fossils apparently deposited at 25.5 Ma. Here, we use magnetostratigraphic and radiochronologic dating to revise the chronology of elevation estimates from the Lunpola Basin. The updated ages reconcile previous results and indicate that the elevations of central Tibet were generally low ({\textless}2.3 km) at 39.5 Ma and high (3.5 to 4.5 km) at {\textasciitilde}26 Ma. This supports the existence in the Eocene of low-elevation longitudinally oriented narrow regions until their uplift in the early Miocene, with potential implications for the growth mechanisms of the Tibetan Plateau, Asian atmospheric circulation, surface processes, and biotic evolution.
Revised age control and paleoelevations reveal Eocene low central Tibet until {\textasciitilde}26 Ma ago when an extensive plateau began to form.

However, newly discovered fossils from a present elevation of ∼4,850 m in central Tibet improve substantially our knowledge of the ancient Tibetan environment. The 70 plant fossil taxa so far recovered include the first occurrences of several modern Asian lineages and represent a Middle Eocene (∼47 Mya) humid subtropical ecosystem. The fossils not only record the diverse composition of the ancient Tibetan biota, but also allow us to constrain the Middle Eocene land surface height in central Tibet to ∼1,500 ± 900 m, and quantify the prevailing thermal and hydrological regime. This “Shangri-La”–like ecosystem experienced monsoon seasonality with a mean annual temperature of ∼19 °C, and frosts were rare. It contained few Gondwanan taxa, yet was compositionally similar to contemporaneous floras in both North America and Europe. Our discovery quantifies a key part of Tibetan Paleogene topography and climate, and highlights the importance of Tibet in regard to the origin of modern Asian plant species and the evolution of global biodiversity.},

The theory predicts the width of the Hadley cell, the total poleward heat flux, the latitude of the upper level jet in the zonal wind, and the distribution of surface easterlies and westerlies.

	abstract = {The arid interior of Asia is the largest source of dust deposited in the North Pacific Ocean, and some dust is even transported to Greenland. Investigating the provenance history of Asian dust can provide strong constraints on the evolution of topography and climate in the Asian interior. Eolian dust Nd isotopic records preserved in North Pacific Ocean sediments since ∼40 Ma provide a spatially integrated first-order constraint on the provenance changes of Asian dust. However, a lack of similarly long dust Nd isotopic records from Asian dust source areas, namely, the northern Tibetan Plateau and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, has hindered a full understanding of Asian dust provenance changes linked to the Cenozoic evolution of tectonics, climate and topography in inland Asia. Here, we have constructed the first fine-grained and whole-rock Nd isotopic records from sediments deposited on the northern Tibetan Plateau since ∼ 52 Ma. The results indicate two major changes, a gradual increase in εNd(0) values between ∼42 Ma and ∼25 Ma and a general decrease since ∼25 Ma, which were probably caused by the incremental northward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Further mass balance estimates based on comparisons between the Nd isotopic characteristics of dust from the northern Tibetan Plateau and the North Pacific Ocean indicate that a rapid increase in the contribution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt to Asian dust at ∼25 Ma can be closely linked to rapid exhumation caused by tectonic uplift and aridification in inland Asia. Our provenance analyses, together with the onset of eolian sediment in central and eastern Asia, suggest that a modern-like regime promoting Asian dust emissions and transport might have been in place since the late Oligocene.},

The change is marked by a global shift in deep-sea {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{δ}$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}/span{\textgreater} representing a combination of deep-ocean cooling and growth in land ice volume. At the same time, multiple independent proxies for ocean temperature indicate sea surface cooling, and major changes in global fauna and flora record a shift toward more cold-climate-adapted species. The two principal suggested explanations of this transition are a decline in atmospheric {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and changes to ocean gateways, while orbital forcing likely influenced the precise timing of the glaciation. Here we review and synthesise proxy evidence of palaeogeography, temperature, ice sheets, ocean circulation and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} change from the marine and terrestrial realms. Furthermore, we quantitatively compare proxy records of change to an ensemble of climate model simulations of temperature change across the EOT. The simulations compare three forcing mechanisms across the EOT: {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} decrease, palaeogeographic changes and ice sheet growth. Our model ensemble results demonstrate the need for a global cooling mechanism beyond the imposition of an ice sheet or palaeogeographic changes. We find that {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} forcing involving a large decrease in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} of ca. 40 \% ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼325{\textless}/span{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}ppm{\textless}/span{\textgreater} drop) provides the best fit to the available proxy evidence, with ice sheet and palaeogeographic changes playing a secondary role. While this large decrease is consistent with some {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} proxy records (the extreme endmember of{\textless}span id="page270"/{\textgreater} decrease), the positive feedback mechanisms on ice growth are so strong that a modest {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} decrease beyond a critical threshold for ice sheet initiation is well capable of triggering rapid ice sheet growth. Thus, the amplitude of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} decrease signalled by our data–model comparison should be considered an upper estimate and perhaps artificially large, not least because the current generation of climate models do not include dynamic ice sheets and in some cases may be under-sensitive to {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} forcing. The model ensemble also cannot exclude the possibility that palaeogeographic changes could have triggered a reduction in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Three recent papers on the cyclostratigraphic duration of the Rhaetian, Hettangian and part of the Toarcian contradict the ages obtained by means of geochronology based on U-Pb in volcanic zircons collected in Peru. The goal of this paper is to explain the reasons for these discrepances. INTRODUCTION The ideal for a geologist would be to know the duration of the geological stages (order relations between the units defined by the evolution of fossils) with which he is working. Numerous efforts have been made in recent decades to calibrate the stages of the Phanerozoic with a chronometric time scale (Laskar, 2010). The current literature offers dozens of articles on this problem. Nowadays, specialists mainly use two distinct methods to calibrate geological stages with the usual chronometric scale: (1)those which are deduced from the isotopic ratios of unstable elements with their stable residue (Uranium-Lead, etc.) and (2) those which are based on the cyclicities that are observed in many marine sediments (e.g., alternations of clay levels with more limestones). The first method generally consists of studying the U / Pb ratio with a high precision spectrometer. A series of complex calculations allow us to deduce the formation age of the mineral that contains uranium (e.g., zircons). The second method consists in measuring, in each accurate sedimentary level, the value of the magnetic susceptibility (MS) (or other variables such as the variation of the carbon isotopes present in the sediments). From these measurements we can construct the curve of the variation of the parameters studied. These curves are analyzed at the start with the Fourier series and make it possible to see whether the cyclicity observed in the field is compatible with an astronomical forcing of climatic type variations. Starting from an initial curve with a high density of peaks, various more readable curves are deduced therefrom, and the curve believed to correspond to the best approximation of an astronomical cycle, the duration of which is known (eccentricity, precession, obliquity). These choices are difficult to make and the results often look spectacular.},

The shipboard age model based on biostratigraphic data and paleomagnetic reversals shows that IODP Site U1447 preserves late Miocene ({\textasciitilde}10 Ma) sediments. Nd/Sr isotope systematics demonstrates that the sediments originated mainly from the Myanmar region, including the Irrawaddy River, Salween River, Sittang River and Indo-Burman-Arakan Ranges without a significant change of sediment provenance since the late Miocene. Thus, temporal variations of clay mineral compositions, represented as smectite/(illite + chlorite) [S/(I + C)], indicate the long-term variations of physical/chemical weathering intensity attributable to intensity changes of Indian winter/summer monsoon. A gradual decreasing trend of S/(I + C) ratios indicates stronger physical and/or weaker chemical weathering since the late Miocene, as a result of strengthening of Indian winter monsoon (and/or weakening of Indian summer monsoon), which seems be closely related to global cooling since the late Miocene. Distinct decrease of S/(I + C) ratios occurred at {\textasciitilde}9.2–8.5 Ma, {\textasciitilde}3.6 Ma, {\textasciitilde}2.4 Ma, and {\textasciitilde}1.2 Ma, which may be attributed to the combined effect of both global cooling and Tibetan Plateau Uplift as a local response. In addition, δ13CSOM values at IODP Site U1447 were higher at {\textasciitilde}3.5 Ma and after 1.5 Ma when S/(I + C) ratio was minima, which may imply an increase of C4 plant in Myanmar region as a result the strong Indian winter monsoon (or weak Indian summer monsoon).},

Here, we present the first long-term clay mineral record combined with Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from a 200-m-long sediment core from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 758 in the southern BoB to establish past variations in sediment sources and river evolution that have occurred since the late Eocene. Provenance analysis suggests that the contribution of the Himalayan source materials from the Irrawaddy and Brahmaputra Rivers to the study site became more important and stable since 22 Ma and 8 Ma, respectively. This new evidence indicates that the Brahmaputra and Irrawaddy Rivers were possibly initiated in the early Miocene ({\textasciitilde}22 Ma). Considering the timing of major tectonic and climatic evolution in South Asia, we conclude that the two phases of tectonic uplift of the Himalayan orogen that occurred in the early and late Miocene were the primary controls on river development in South Asia and provenance changes in the southern BoB. Global cooling and Indian drying after the late Miocene could also have strengthened Himalayan erosion and contributed more illite and chlorite to the South Asian margin.},

This study uses reanalysis products European Centre of Medium-Range Forecast Interim reanalysis, Japanese Reanalysis year 55, and High Asia Reanalysis to highlight an easterly, low-level barrier jet along the Indo-Gangetic Plain (referred from here as IG LLJ), which we identify as the primary moisture transport mechanism for the northeastern branch of the IAM. We show that the NCAR family of AGCMs (Community Atmospheric Model (CAM)) does not capture this circulation until 1/2° or greater spatial horizontal resolution is used. The IG LLJ develops due to a persistent low-pressure system centered over the Ganges basin and is enhanced by the Himalayas. Using diabatic heating rates and the moist Froude number as diagnostics, we find that in CAM, this branch of the IAM displays two different dynamical regimes as a function of resolution. At low resolution, the atmosphere near the Himalayas is statically unstable, diabatic heating is strong, and the moisture flow is southwesterly from the Arabian Sea and moves over the terrain (unblocked). At high resolution, the moist static stability near the Himalayan Mountains is stable, diabatic heating is weak, and the flow primarily enters easterly from the Bay of Bengal and moves parallel to the terrain (blocked). During the summer season, the low-resolution CAM is locked into the unblocked mode, which has serious implications for interpreting topography-monsoon interactions. For a broader context, we demonstrate that more than half of the CMIP5 models do not capture the IG LLJ, which further highlights model-data mismatch across the IAM region.},

	abstract = {The modern environment of southern China is dominated by a humid monsoon climate, and presents a striking contrast to the widespread deserts found at similar latitudes elsewhere. The formation of a monsoon climate marks a major environmental shift in southern China during the Cenozoic; however, the origin and possible driving mechanism of the climate transition remain unclear. Paleogene palynological records from seven basins across southern China offer an exceptional opportunity to address this knowledge gap. The Paleogene palynoflora reveals two completely different vegetation and climate patterns: the Paleocene to early Eocene was characterized by a relatively high abundance of xerophilous taxa, suggesting an arid/semi-arid climate; while the middle Eocene to Oligocene supported subtropical wet evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest, characterized by a significant increase in broad-leaved, coniferous taxa and the almost complete disappearance of xerophilous taxa, together indicating the emergence of a warm–humid climate at this time. Combined palynological, sedimentological, paleozoological, and paleobotanical proxy evidence reveal that the major environmental transition occurred roughly around the middle Eocene; this transition may mark the establishment of the monsoon climate. Furthermore, middle Eocene climatic parameters obtained through the Coexistence Approach (CA) were compared with those of modern sites with known climate regimes. The middle Eocene parameters were most similar to those exposed to the modern East Asian Monsoon (EAM), further indicating that the middle Eocene climate of southern China was predominantly influenced by the EAM. The evolution of the Paleogene palynoflora in southern China is largely consistent with global climate change. We infer that the enhancement of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) during the middle Eocene was closely related to long-term global cooling, while the intensified East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) was primarily caused by the northward drift of the Indian Subcontinent and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103410},
	abstract = {Recognition of terrestrial dust in geological records is essential for reconstructing paleoenvironments and quantifying dust fluxes in the past. However, in contrast to eolian sands, silt-sized dust is difficult to recognize in pre-Quaternary records due to a lack of macroscopic features indicating eolian transport and mixing with alluvial sediments. Windblown dust deposits are commonly identified by comparing their sedimentological and petrological features with Quaternary examples of dust known as loess. Here, we review the characteristics of terrestrial dust deposits and conclude that most of these features are not exclusively windblown and may be formed by alluvial deposits as well. We therefore synthesize a set of criteria which enable a reliable identification and quantification of dust while acknowledging potential contributions of alluvial components. These methods include quartz-grain surface morphology analysis to distinguish eolian and alluvial transport modes, provenance studies to identify local and extrabasinal sources, grain-size-shape end-member modelling to quantify the various sedimentary contributions to the record, and a basin-scale stratigraphic approach to derive regional patterns and avoid interpretation of local phenomena. We reassess the Eocene to Pliocene records of the Chinese Loess Plateau and conclude that these strata represent both alluvial and eolian sediments deposited in extensive mudflat systems. Quaternary loess, by contrast, is almost exclusively composed of windblown dust. The early Pleistocene shift from mudflat to loess deposits is associated with a significant increase in accumulation rates, likely due to increased dust production upwind, overwhelming and blanketing the local mudflat systems in central China.},

	abstract = {AimOur aims were to provide new pollen data for establishing a sub-continental surface pollen database (East Asian Pollen Database, EAPD) and to study relationships between vegetation and climate.LocationThe sample sites covered most regions of East Asia, including China, Mongolia, the Russian Far East, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.Methods
Data quality control procedures were applied, including taxonomic standardization, removal of duplicates, and adjustment of geographical coordinates. Vegetation types and climate parameters were assigned to each sample. Modern pollen distribution maps were drawn using circle scattergrams. The plots of pollen percentages versus climate variables allowed quantitative estimates of climate values. The modern analogue technique (MAT) was used to predict modern biomes and climate parameters.ResultsPollen assemblages extracted from 2858 sites were used to model the geographical distribution of selected taxa and their relationships with climate. For most taxa, the reconstructed range fitted the observed geographical distribution rather well. Arboreal pollen (AP) and Pinus dominated the transition zone between forest and steppe. Use of the MAT revealed that the predicted and observed biomes matched in 71\% of the cases. The warm temperate evergreen broadleaf forest had the best agreement between predictions and observations. Climate values reconstructed using MAT were highly correlated with observed values in January temperature. The correlation coefficient of the temperature variables ranged from 0.799 to 0.930 and was as high as 0.939 for precipitation.Main conclusionsThis paper documents a new modern pollen database for East Asia and makes the data readily available. The reconstructed biomes and climate variables are significantly correlated with the observed values, thus demonstrating the utility of the pollen database for future multiscale palaeoenvironmental studies.},

	abstract = {Knowing the evolution history of the climate systems in the Asian inland dominated by either the Westerlies or the Asian monsoon, and understanding their associated driving mechanisms are crucial for assessing future trends of climate and environmental conditions in this region, but both the evolution and mechanisms are still under debate. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of massive data from an accurately dated drill core retrieved from the Westerlies controlled western Qaidam Basin (QB), with records from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) dominated by the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM), to track the time and frequency domain evolution patterns and dynamic changes of the QB and the CLP systems. The results infer two main conclusions. First, a critical transition in the evolution of Qaidam paleolake occurred at 0.8–0.6 Ma, characterized by striking changes in proxy variations and a system shift from periodic variations to more irregular fluctuations after 0.6 Ma. Second, a similar evolution pattern prevailed in the Qaidam paleolake region and in the EASM-dominated CLP between ∼2.7 and ∼1.2 Ma, but a divergence of both systems started at ∼1.2 Ma and fully established after 0.6 Ma, when largely fluctuating climate conditions in the QB with a distinct drying trend was accompanied by synchronous largely fluctuated EASM with an increasing trend after 0.6 Ma. We suggest that ice sheet expansion in the Northern Hemisphere, promoted by co-occurrence of low obliquity amplitudes and low eccentricity, drove both systems across a threshold at ∼1.2 Ma, and the internal forcing due to glaciation disturbed the previous response of both systems to solar insolation and led to the divergence of two systems. At ∼0.9–0.8 Ma, a node of the 1.2-Myr obliquity cycle co-occurred with an eccentricity minimum, which together with coeval decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration, could have facilitated a striking expansion of ice sheets. The resulting more equatorial and zonally oriented northern hemisphere westerly jet could serve as key factor leading to the final collapse of Qaidam paleolake after ∼0.6 Ma, and the divergence of the QB and the CLP systems.},

	abstract = {The prevailing mid-latitude westerly winds, known as the westerlies, are a fundamental component of the climate system because they have a crucial role in driving surface ocean circulation1 and modulating air–sea heat, momentum and carbon exchange1–3. Recent work suggests that westerly wind belts are migrating polewards in response to anthropogenic forcing4,5. Reconstructing the westerlies during past warm periods such as the Pliocene epoch, in which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) was about 350 to 450 parts per million6 and temperatures were about 2 to 4 degrees Celsius higher than today7, can improve our understanding of changes in the position and strength of these wind systems as the climate continues to warm. Here we show that the westerlies were weaker and more poleward during the warm Pliocene than during glacial periods after the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG), which occurred around 2.73 million years ago8. Our results, which are based on dust and export productivity reconstructions, indicate that major ice sheet development during the iNHG was accompanied by substantial increases in dust fluxes in the mid-latitude North Pacific Ocean, especially compared to those in the subarctic North Pacific. Following this shift, changes in dust and productivity largely track the glacial–interglacial cycles of the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs. On the basis of this pattern, we infer that shifts in the westerlies were primarily driven by variations in Plio-Pleistocene thermal gradients and ice volume. By combining this relationship with other dust records9–11 and climate modelling results12, we find that the proposed changes in the westerlies were globally synchronous. If the Pliocene is predictive of future warming, we posit that continued poleward movement and weakening of the present-day westerlies in both hemispheres can be expected.},

A careful appraisal of the main processes controlling past warm events is essential to inform future climates and ultimately provide decision makers with a clear understanding of the processes at play in a warmer world. In this context, intervals of greenhouse climates, such as the thermal maximum of the Cenomanian–Turonian ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼94{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;Ma) during the Cretaceous Period, are of particular interest. Here we use the IPSL-CM5A2 (IPSL: Institut Pierre et Simon Laplace) Earth system model to unravel the forcing parameters of the Cenomanian–Turonian greenhouse climate. We perform six simulations with an incremental change in five major boundary conditions in order to isolate their respective role on climate change between the Cenomanian–Turonian and the preindustrial. Starting with a preindustrial simulation, we implement the following changes in boundary conditions: (1) the absence of polar ice sheets, (2) the increase in atmospheric {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} to 1120\&thinsp;ppm, (3) the change in vegetation and soil parameters, (4) the 1\&thinsp;\% decrease in the Cenomanian–Turonian value of the solar constant and (5) the Cenomanian–Turonian palaeogeography. Between the preindustrial simulation and the Cretaceous simulation, the model simulates a global warming of more than 11\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C. Most of this warming is driven by the increase in atmospheric {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} to 1120\&thinsp;ppm. Palaeogeographic changes represent the second major contributor to global warming, whereas the reduction in the solar constant counteracts most of geographically driven warming. We further demonstrate that the implementation of Cenomanian–Turonian boundary conditions flattens meridional temperature gradients compared to the preindustrial simulation. Interestingly, we show that palaeogeography is the major driver of the flattening in the low latitudes to midlatitudes, whereas {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} rise and polar ice sheet retreat dominate the high-latitude response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The method involves defining an analytical set of mesh parallels in the stereographic polar plan, computing the associated set of mesh meridians, and projecting the resulting mesh onto the sphere. The set of mesh parallels proposed here is defined as a series of embedded circles. The resulting mesh presents no loss of continuity in either the mesh lines or the scale factors over the whole ocean domain, as the mesh is not a composite mesh. Thus, the Bering Strait can be opened without specific treatment. The equator is a mesh line, which provides a better numerical solution for equatorial dynamics. The resolution can be easily controlled through the definition of three analytical functions which can increase resolution and/or maintain a low ratio of anisotropy. The mesh has been implemented in the LODYC general circulation ocean model. Results of a semi-diagnostic simulation are shown.},

	abstract = {Tropical Africa is home to an astonishing biodiversity occurring in a variety of ecosystems. Past climatic change and geological events have impacted the evolution and diversification of this biodiversity. During the last two decades, around 90 dated molecular phylogenies of different clades across animals and plants have been published leading to an increased understanding of the diversification and speciation processes generating tropical African biodiversity. In parallel, extended geological and palaeoclimatic records together with detailed numerical simulations have refined our understanding of past geological and climatic changes in Africa. To date, these important advances have not been reviewed within a common framework. Here, we critically review and synthesize African climate, tectonics and terrestrial biodiversity evolution throughout the Cenozoic to the mid-Pleistocene, drawing on recent advances in Earth and life sciences. We first review six major geo-climatic periods defining tropical African biodiversity diversification by synthesizing 89 dated molecular phylogeny studies. Two major geo-climatic factors impacting the diversification of the sub-Saharan biota are highlighted. First, Africa underwent numerous climatic fluctuations at ancient and more recent timescales, with tectonic, greenhouse gas, and orbital forcing stimulating diversification. Second, increased aridification since the Late Eocene led to important extinction events, but also provided unique diversification opportunities shaping the current tropical African biodiversity landscape. We then review diversification studies of tropical terrestrial animal and plant clades and discuss three major models of speciation: (i) geographic speciation via vicariance (allopatry); (ii) ecological speciation impacted by climate and geological changes, and (iii) genomic speciation via genome duplication. Geographic speciation has been the most widely documented to date and is a common speciation model across tropical Africa. We conclude with four important challenges faced by tropical African biodiversity research: (i) to increase knowledge by gathering basic and fundamental biodiversity information; (ii) to improve modelling of African geophysical evolution throughout the Cenozoic via better constraints and downscaling approaches; (iii) to increase the precision of phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular dating of tropical African clades by using next generation sequencing approaches together with better fossil calibrations; (iv) finally, as done here, to integrate data better from Earth and life sciences by focusing on the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of tropical African biodiversity in a wider geodiversity context.},

	abstract = {The Tethys Ocean was compartmentalized into the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean during the early Miocene, yet the exact nature and timing of this disconnection are not well understood. Here we present two new neodymium isotope records from isolated carbonate platforms on both sides of the closing seaway, Malta (outcrop sampling) and the Maldives (IODP Site U1468), to constrain the evolution of past water mass exchange between the present day Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean via the Mesopotamian Seaway. Combining these data with box modeling results indicates that water mass exchange was reduced by {\textasciitilde}90\% in a first step at ca. 20 Ma. The terminal closure of the seaway then coincided with the sea level drop caused by the onset of permanent glaciation of Antarctica at ca. 13.8 Ma. The termination of meridional water mass exchange through the Tethyan Seaway resulted in a global reorganization of currents, paved the way to the development of upwelling in the Arabian Sea and possibly led to a strengthening of South Asian Monsoon.},

	abstract = {[Some considerations on the palaeogeography of the Mediterranean and Paratethys Oligocene to Miocene are presented in ten time-slices. The time-slices start with the vanishing Tethys Ocean in the late Eocene and the birth of two new marine realms at its western end: the Mediterranean Sea and the intercontinental Eurasian Paratethys basin. The time-slices were selected according to general palaeogeographic changes of seaways and arising land bridges for continental migrations. The palaeogeographic sketches were based on Cenozoic plate reconstructions, and the intermediate levels are interpolated accordingly. Strong changes occurred in the history of the Paratethys. From an open ocean in the Eocene with connections to the Polar Sea via the Turgai Strait, it changed to an enclosed basin in the early Oligocene with reduced salinity and endemic faunas. From the middle Oligocene on, the basin opened again, reaching a maximum connection with the Indian Ocean during late Oligocene and early Miocene (late Chattian – early Burdigalian). Intermittent seaways and regional close-off of basins with endemic development characterize the late Burdigalian and middle Miocene. By the mid-Serravallian the final disconnection of the Paratethys occurred, and since Sarmatian time reduced salinity conditions and endemisms prevailed. The Mediterranean was the connecting sea between Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans until the late Burdigalian. With the collision of the Arabian and Anatolian plates in the late Burdigalian, an Eurasian – African landbridge opened for mammal migrations. A short interruption is proposed for the Langhian transgression, followed by a final closure in the Serravallian. In einer kurzen Übersicht werden neue Überlegungen zur Paläogeographie des Oligozän und Miozän von Mediterran und Paratethys gegeben. Die skizzenhafte Darstellung zeigt die Verteilung von Meer und Festland in einer Serie von zehn Zeitschnitten. Einerseits soll die regionale Entwicklung mit ihren wesentlichen paläogeographischen Veränderungen klar ersichtlich sein, andererseits wird versucht die interkontinentalen Migrationsmöglichkeiten der Säugetierfaunen zwischen Eurasien und Afrika zu dokumentieren. Als Grundlage wurden plattentektonische Darstellungen verwendet, die für mehrere magnetochronologische Zeitebenen vorlagen. Die dazwischenliegenden Zeitschnitte wurden intrapoliert. Die Darstellungen beginnen mit dem Obereozän, dem Zeitraum, in dem der Tethys Ozean durch die Norddrift von Indien und die im Gegenuhrzeigersinn erfolgende Rotation von Afrika allmählich verschwand. Die Turgai-Straße in Westsibirien verband die Tethys mit dem Polarmeer und verhinderte einen kontinentalen Faunenaustausch zwischen Europa und Asien. Die Zeitebene basiert auf der Plattenverteilung im Chron 15, vor zirka 35 Millionen Jahren. Im untersten Oligozän (unterstes Kiscellien – Pshekien) bildete sich durch tektonische Vorgänge eine Ost–West gerichtete Schwellenzone, die am Westende der Tethys im Süden das Mediterran und im Norden das intrakontinentale Meer der Paratethys entstehen ließ. Die Turgai-Straße verlandete und ermöglichte den Faunenaustausch zwischen Europa und Asien ("Grande Coupure"). Im Norden bestand über die polnisch-dänische Meeresstraße ein mariner Faunenaustausch bis in das Kaspische Becken. In der Paratethys kam es durch die Abschnürung und das Absenken tiefer Becken zu anoxischen Ablagerungsbedingungen. Im tieferen Oligozän (mittleres Kiscellien - Solenovien) erreichte die Abschnürung der Paratethys ihren Höhepunkt. Nur am Westende, über die Prealps in Savoyen und über den Rheingraben bestanden noch schmale Verbindungen zu offenen Meeren. Weit verbreitet lagerten sich monospezifische Nannoplanktonmergel und Diatomite ab; der Salzgehalt sank stark ab. Über die ganze Paratethys vom Kaspischen Becken bis in die oberösterreichische Molasse breitete sich eine kleinwüchsige, endemische Bivalvenfauna aus ("Cardium" lipoldi - Janschinella-Fauna). Das Mediterran blieb weiterhin in offener Verbindung zum Indopazifik und Atlantik.. Der nächste Zeitschnitt im Untermiozän (Aquitanien - oberes Egerien - Karadzhalgan) beruht auf der Platten Verteilung in Chron 6B (23 Mill. Jahre). Dieses Niveau zeigt die weite Öffnung der Paratethys zum Indopazifik über den Iran, die im ganzen Becken vollmarine Verhältnisse und Warmwasserfaunen brachte. Von eher lokaler Bedeutung ist das Schließen des Rheingrabens und der alpinen Vortiefe zwischen dem Rhonebecken und Bayern. Im Mediterran begann die Öffnung des Balearen-Beckens und die Auffaltung und ostwärts gerichtete Überschiebung des Apenninenbogens. Durch die Rotation der Arabischen Platte öffnete sich der Graben des Roten Meeres. Ein kontinentaler Faunenaustausch zwischen Eurasien und Afrika war weiterhin nicht möglich. Erst im höheren Untermiozän (oberes Burdigalien - Ottnangien - unteres Kotsakhurien) schloß sich eine Landbrücke zwischen der Arabischen und der Anatolischen Platte. Die Verbindung zum Indischen Ozean wurde unterbrochen. Die Östliche Paratethys wurde zu einem abgeschnürten Becken mit endemischen Brackwasserbedingungen. In der Westlichen und Zentralen Paratethys bestanden vollmarine Verhältnisse mit einer offenen Verbindung zum Mediterran. Die westliche, alpine Vortiefe wurde in der Oberen Meeresmolasse neuerlich überflutet. Der Apennin setzte seine Bewegung mit einer Rotation im Gegenuhrzeigersinn fort. Durch tektonische Bewegungen kam es am Ende des Untermiozän zu großräumigen Umgestaltungen im Westen der Paratethys. Die West-Ost gerichteten Tröge wurden weitgehend durch intramontane Becken abgelöst (oberstes Untermiozän - oberstes Burdigalien - Karpatien - oberes Kotsakhurien). Das Meer zog sich aus der Alpenvortiefe, aus dem Transsylvanischen Becken und dem Balkan zurück. Über Slovenien bestand eine Meeresverbindung ins Pannonische Becken und von dort aus in die westliche Karpatenvortiefe. Die Östliche Paratethys blieb weiterhin isoliert. Die Landbrücke zwischen Eurasien und Afrika bestand wahrscheinlich noch, war aber schon stärker eingeschnürt. Im unteren Mittelmiozän (Langhien - unteres Badenien - Tarkhanien) nahmen die tektonischen Aktivitäten weiter zu. Die Meeresstraße zwischen Mediterran und Indischem Ozean öffnete sich neuerlich an der Naht zwischen Arabischer und Anatolischer Platte. Aber auch über Ostanatolien wurde die Verbindung zur Östlichen Paratethys wieder aktiv. Eine Transgression ließ in der Paratethys vom Kaspischen Becken bis in die Karpaten-Vortiefe und das Wiener Becken, aber auch in den intramontanen Becken in Transsylvanien und in Ungarn, marine Ablagerungsräume entstehen. Eine westliche Verbindung zum Mittelmeer bestand über Slovenien. Da aber zwischen der Biofazies der Östlichen und Zentralen Paratethys tiefgreifende Unterschiede bestehen, wird eine hypotethische Meeresverbindung zwischen dem Südrand der Schwarzmeer-Platte und dem Nordrand der Anatolischen-Platte angenommen. Durch eine derartige Meeresstraße läßt sich die vollmarine, tropisch-subtropische, einheitliche Fauna in der Karpatenvortiefe und in Transsylvanien beziehen. Eine neuerliche Umgestaltung erfolgt zu Beginn des Serravallien (mittleres Badenien - Karaganien). Die Meeresverbindung vom Indischen Ozean zum Mediterran wurde im Nahen Osten endgültig und zur Paratethys vorübergehend geschlossen. Die Levante Störung wurde ebenso wie die Ost-und Nordanatolische Störungszone aktiv. Dies wurde durch die endgültige Kollision der Arabischen und Anatolischen Platte in der Bitlis Zone verursacht. Die Abschnürung der Paratethys war gleichzeitig mit einem neuerlichen Zerfall in zwei getrennte Bioprovinzen verbunden. Die Östliche Paratethys wurde im Karaganien wiederum zu einem endemischen Brackwasserbecken mit einer Fauna, die von der Bivalve Spaniodontella dominiert war. In der Zentralen Paratethys blieb die Verbindung über den "Trans-Tethyan-Trench-Corridor" in Slovenien zum Mediterran bestehen. Regressionen setzten auch hier ein und brachten im höheren Mittelbaden die Abschnürung der Karpatenvortiefe und des Transsylvanischen Beckens mit mächtigen Evaporitbildungen. Der nächste Schritt der paläogeographischen Entwicklung erfolgt sehr rasch, noch immer im unteren Serravallien (oberes Badenien/Kosovien - Konkian). Durch eine neuerliche Transgression wurde fast das gleiche Gebiet der Paratethys wie im unteren Badenien/Tarkhanien überflutet. Entlang der Störungszonen in Ostanatolien öffnete sich die alte Meeresstraße zum Indischen Ozean. Die Verbindung zum Mediterran im Westen hatte sich geschlossen. Die Fazies zwischen Östlicher und Zentraler Paratethys war zwar sehr ähnlich, im unteren Kosovien des Transsylvanischen Beckens und der Karpatenvortiefe bestanden aber die besten marinen Bedingungen mit der Ablagerung von Radiolarien-Schichten. Darüber folgten in der gesamten Zentralen Paratethys Pteropodenmergel, die im oberen Kosovien von einer regressiven Phase mit Faunenverarmung abgelöst wurden. Der Mikrofossilinhalt und die Fischfauna des oberen Badenien belegen eine indopazifische Verbindung, die sich deutlich vom Serravallien des Mediterran unterscheidet. Als letzter Zeitschnitt wird das untere Sarmatien (Volhynien) präsentiert. Die Paratethys wurde im oberen Kosovien/Konkien vom Indopazifik getrennt. Eine neue Meeresstraße öffnete sich entlang der Ostanatolische Störungszone zwischen Mediterran und Östlicher Paratethys. Sie folgte dem oberen Euphrat-Tal in das Araks-Becken und das Kaspische Becken. In der gesamten Paratethys entstand im Untersarmat eine einheitliche Fauna mit vielen Endemismen bei reduzierter Salinität und starker Zunahme des Karbonatgehaltes und der Alkalinität. Das Ende der Paratethys mit zunehmender Kontinentalisierung und Verlagerung der aquatischen Bereiche in den Osten wurde in diesen Skizzen nicht mehr dargestellt.]},

	abstract = {Paleogeographical considerations on the development of the Paratethys and the Mediterranean during Oligocene and Miocene are presented in twelve time-slices. Plate tectonic activities and the collision of India with Asia caused the destruction of the Western Tethys Ocean in the Late Eocene. The Mediterranean and the intracontinental Paratethys basins came into existence as new marine realms. In the Mediterranean Basin open oceanic connections existed throughout the Oligocene and most of the Miocene. The Eastern Paratethys and the Central to Western Paratethys showed different marine conditions and changing connections most of the time. A first period with reduced salinity, anoxic bottom conditions, and strong endemisms occurred throughout the Paratethys in a short period of the Lower Oligocene (Solenovian, NP 23). It was followed by more open marine conditions with wide-spread clastic sedimentation (Upper Kiscellian, Kalmykian, NP 24). By the collision of Africa and Arabia with Eurasia, the seaway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean was closed in Burdigalian time, but a new landbridge enabled a distinct mammal migration between the continents (Gomphotherium Landbridge). During the Middle Miocene marine seaways between the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Paratethys opened and closed intermittently. Finally, the marine connections of the Paratethys were strongly reduced, and gave way to the endemic faunal development during the later Miocene (Sarmatian to Pontian).},

	abstract = {[Studies of ancient sea levels provide insights into the mechanisms and rates of sea level changes due to tectonic processes (e.g., ocean crust production) and climatic variations (e.g., insolation due to Earth’s orbital changes and atmospheric CO₂). Global mean sea level (GMSL) changes since the Middle Eocene (ca. 48 million years ago [Ma]) have been primarily driven by ice volume changes paced on astronomical timescales (2400, 1200, 95/125, 41, and 19/23 thousand years [kyr]), modulated by changes in atmospheric CO₂. During peak warm intervals (e.g., Early Eocene Climatic Optimum 56–48 Ma and the early Late Cretaceous ca. 100–80 Ma), atmospheric CO₂ was high and Earth was more than 5°C warmer and mostly ice-free, contributing {\textasciitilde}66 m of GMSL rise from ice alone. However, even in the warmest times (e.g., Early Eocene, ca 50 Ma), growth and decay of small ice sheets (25 m sea level equivalent) likely drove sea level changes that inundated continents and controlled the record of shallow-water deposits. Ice sheets were confined to the interior of Antarctica prior to the Oligocene and first reached the Antarctic coast at 34 Ma, with the lowest sea levels –20±10 m relative to modern GMSL. Following a near ice-free Miocene Climatic Optimum (17–13.8 Ma), a permanent East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) developed in the Middle Miocene (ca. 13.8 Ma). During the Pliocene (4–3 Ma), CO₂ was similar to 2020 CE (Common Era) and sea levels stood {\textasciitilde}22±10 m above present, requiring significant loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet ({\textasciitilde}7 m of sea level), West Antarctic Ice Sheet ({\textasciitilde}5 m after isostatic compensation), and vulnerable portions of the EAIS. The small Northern Hemisphere ice sheets of the Eocene to Pliocene expanded into continental scale in the Quaternary (past 2.55 million years). Sea level reached its lowest point ({\textasciitilde}130 m below present) during the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 27–20 thousand years before 1950 [ka]), episodically rose during the deglaciation (ca. 20–11 ka) at rates that at times were in excess of 47 mm yr–1 (vs. modern rates of 3.2 mm yr–1), and progressively slowed during the Early to Middle Holocene from ca. 11 ka until {\textasciitilde}4 ka. During the Late Holocene (last 4.2 kyr, including the CE), GMSL only exhibited multi-centennial variability of ±0.1 m. The modern episode of GMSL rise began in the late nineteenth century, with most of the twentieth century rise attributable to global warming and ice melt. Under moderate emissions scenarios, GMSL is likely to rise 0.4–1.0 m in this century, with ancient analogs suggesting a longer term (centennial to millennial scale) equilibrium rise of {\textasciitilde}10 m. Under higher emissions scenarios, twenty-first century GMSL will rise greater than 2 m, and in the long term, tens of meters cannot be excluded.]},

	abstract = {The Iranian plateau is a vast inland region with a smooth average elevation of c. 1.5 km formed at the rear of the Zagros orogen as a result of the Arabia-Eurasia collision (i.e., over the last 30–35 Myr). This collision zone is of particular interest due to its disputed resemblance to the faster Himalayan collision, which gave birth to the Tibetan plateau around 50 Myr ago. Recent studies have suggested that a recent (10–5 Ma) slab break-off event below Central Iran caused the formation of the Iranian plateau. Here, we test several hypotheses through large-scale (3082 × 590 km) numerical models of continental subduction models that incorporate a free upper surface erosion, rheological stratification, brittle-elastic-ductile rheologies, and metamorphic phase changes (density and physical properties) and account for the specific crustal and thermal structure of the Arabian and Iranian continental lithospheres. We test the impact of the transition from oceanic to continental subduction and the topographic consequences of the progressive slowdown of the convergence rate during continental subduction. Our results demonstrate the role of mantle flow beneath the overriding plate, initiated as an indirect consequence of slab break-off. This flow creates a dynamic topography support during continental subduction and results in delamination of the overriding plate lithospheric mantle followed by isostatic readjustment, hence of further uplift and maintenance of a plateau-like topography without significant crustal thickening. The slowdown of the convergence rate during the development of the continental subduction/collision phase largely contributes to this process by controlling the timing and depth of slab break-off.},

	abstract = {The southern Alborz mountains of northern Iran are an integral part of the Arabia/Eurasia collision zone. A magnetostratigraphic and rock magnetic investigation of the Eyvanekey stratigraphic section in the southern Alborz mountains reveals the spatiotemporal character of sedimentary facies migration in the Alborz foreland basin. The section constitutes three coarsening upward units (units 1, 2, and 3), comprising the Upper Red and Hezardarreh formations. Our data reveal that the Upper Red Formation was deposited between 17.5 and 7.5 Ma, while the depositional age of the top of the Hezardarreh Formation can be extrapolated to ∼6.2 Ma. Slow sediment accumulation rates correlate with sedimentary facies comprising prograding, coarsening-upward units. This is likely the result of intraforeland uplift (units 1 and 2) and basin inversion, probably associated with a growth syncline located in the proximal foreland (unit 3). In contrast, fine-grained strata at the bottom of each cycle are associated with faster sediment accumulation rates, testifying to enhanced flexural basin subsidence in the course of thrust loading. Progradation of coarse-grained facies also occurred during relatively fast sediment accumulation (top of unit 2), suggesting that the influx of coarse-grained sediment outpaced the storage capacity of the proximal foreland. Thus, despite an overall southward propagation of deformation into the southern Alborz foreland, the locus of active deformation must have migrated back and forth on a time scale of circa 0.7 to 2 Ma.},

Here we present geological evidence and geodynamic model results that suggest that the Nile drainage has been stable for {\textasciitilde}30 million years. We suggest that the Nile’s longevity in essentially the same path is sustained by the persistence of a stable topographic gradient, which in turn is controlled by deeper mantle processes. We propose that a large mantle convection cell beneath the Nile region has controlled topography over the last 30 million years, inducing uplift in the Ethiopian–Yemen Dome and subsidence in the Levant Sea and northern Egypt. We conclude that the drainage system of large rivers and their evolution over time can be sustained by a dynamic topographic gradient.},

	abstract = {The idea that climatically modulated erosion may impact orogenic processes has challenged geoscientists for decades. Although modeling studies and physical calculations have provided a solid theoretical basis supporting this interaction, to date, field-based work has produced inconclusive results. The central–western Alborz Mountains in the northern sectors of the Arabia–Eurasia collision zone constitute a promising area to explore these potential feedbacks. This region is characterized by asymmetric precipitation superimposed on an orogen with a history of spatiotemporal changes in exhumation rates, deformation patterns, and prolonged, km-scale base-level changes. Our analysis suggests that despite the existence of a strong climatic gradient at least since 17.5 Ma, the early orogenic evolution (from ∼36 to 9–6 Ma) was characterized by decoupled orographic precipitation and tectonics. In particular, faster exhumation and sedimentation along the more arid southern orogenic flank point to a north-directed accretionary flux and underthrusting of Central Iran. Conversely, from ∼6 to 3 Ma, erosion rates along the northern orogenic flank became higher than those in the south, where they dropped to minimum values. This change occurred during a ∼3-Myr-long, km-scale base-level lowering event in the Caspian Sea. We speculate that mass redistribution processes along the northern flank of the Alborz and presumably across all mountain belts adjacent to the South Caspian Basin and more stable areas of the Eurasian plate increased the sediment load in the basin and ultimately led to the underthrusting of the Caspian Basin beneath the Alborz Mountains. This underthrusting in turn triggered a new phase of northward orogenic expansion, transformed the wetter northern flank into a new pro-wedge, and led to the establishment of apparent steady-state conditions along the northern orogenic flank (i.e., rock uplift equal to erosion rates). Conversely, the southern mountain front became the retro-wedge and experienced limited tectonic activity. These observations overall raise the possibility that mass-distribution processes during a pronounced erosion phase driven by base-level changes may have contributed to the inferred regional plate-tectonic reorganization of the northern Arabia–Eurasia collision during the last ∼5 Ma.},

	abstract = {It has been demonstrated in climate models that both the Indian and East Asian summer monsoons (ISM and EASM) are strengthened by the uplift of the entire Asian orography or Tibetan Plateau (TP) (i.e. bulk mountain uplift). Such an effect is widely perceived as the major mechanism contributing to the evolution of Asian summer monsoons in the Neogene. However, geological evidence suggests more diachronous growth of the Asian orography (i.e. regional mountain uplift) than bulk mountain uplift. This demands a re-evaluation of the relation between mountain uplift and the Asian monsoon in the geological periods. In this study, sensitivity experiments considering the diachronous growth of different parts of the Asian orography are performed using the regional climate model COSMO-CLM to investigate their effects on the Asian summer monsoons. The results show that, different from the bulk mountain uplift, the regional mountain uplift can lead to an asynchronous development of the ISM and EASM. While the ISM is primarily intensified by the thermal insulation (mechanical blocking) effect of the southern TP (Zagros Mountains), the EASM is mainly enhanced by the surface sensible heating of the central, northern and eastern TP. Such elevated surface heating can induce a low-level cyclonic anomaly around the TP that reduces the ISM by suppressing the lower tropospheric monsoon vorticity, but promotes the EASM by strengthening the warm advection from the south of the TP that sustains the monsoon convection. Our findings provide new insights to the evolution of the Asian summer monsoons and their interaction with the tectonic changes in the Neogene.},

recent geological period with present-like atmospheric pCO2 and is thus expected to have exhibited a warm climate similar to or warmer
than the present day. On the basis of understanding that has been gathered on
the climate variability of this interval, a specific interglacial (Marine
Isotope Stage KM5c, MIS KM5c; 3.205 Ma) has been selected for the Pliocene
Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (PlioMIP 2). We carried out a series
of experiments according to the design of PlioMIP2 with two versions of the
Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) atmosphere–ocean coupled general circulation model (AOGCM): IPSL-CM5A
and IPSL-CM5A2. Compared to the PlioMIP 1 experiment, run with IPSL-CM5A, our
results show that the simulated MIS KM5c climate presents enhanced warming
in mid- to high latitudes, especially over oceanic regions. This warming can
be largely attributed to the enhanced Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation caused by the high-latitude seaway changes. The sensitivity
experiments, conducted with IPSL-CM5A2, show that besides the increased
pCO2, both modified orography and reduced ice sheets contribute
substantially to mid- to high latitude warming in MIS KM5c. When considering
the pCO2 uncertainties (+/-50 ppmv) during the Pliocene, the
response of the modeled mean annual surface air temperature to changes to
pCO2 (+/-50 ppmv) is not symmetric, which is likely due to the
nonlinear response of the cryosphere (snow cover and sea ice extent). By
analyzing the Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance, we also demonstrate
its vulnerability under both MIS KM5c and modern warm climate.},

	abstract = {Two fundamental questions about the ice-age climate system await satisfactory resolution. First, if summer solar radiation intensity truly controls the orbital signature of the last glacial cycle, then why were major climatic shifts, including the last termination, globally synchronous? Second, what caused the millennial-scale climate oscillations superimposed on this cycle? We address these questions from a Southern Hemisphere perspective focused on mid-latitude mountain ice fields. We put particular emphasis on the last glacial termination, which involved both orbital-scale and millennial-scale climate elements and has generally well-resolved chronological control. Sustained retreat of mountain glaciers, documented by detailed mapping and chronology of glacial landforms in the Southern Alps and southern Andes, marked the termination of the last ice age, beginning ∼18 kyrs ago and involved a change from glacial to near-interglacial atmospheric temperature within a millennium or two. A rapid poleward shift of the Subtropical Front, delineating the northern margin of the Southern Ocean, ∼18 kyrs ago implies a concurrent poleward shift of the austral westerlies and leads us to hypothesize a southern origin for the dominant phase of the last glacial termination. Together with interhemispheric paleoclimate records and with results of coupled ocean-atmosphere climate modeling, these findings suggest a big, fast, and global end to the last ice age in which a southern-sourced warming episode linked the hemispheres. We posit that a shift in the Southern Ocean circulation and austral westerly wind system, tied to southern orbital forcing, caused this global warming episode by affecting the tropical heat engine and hence global climate. Central to this hypothesis, dubbed the ‘Zealandia Switch’, is the location of the Australia and Zealandia continents relative to Southern Hemisphere oceanic and atmospheric circulation. Coupled ocean-atmosphere climate modeling shows that the locus of the austral westerlies, whether in a more equatorward position representing a glacial-mode climate or in a poleward-shifted position marking interglacial-mode climate, has profound effects on oceanic and associated atmospheric linkages between the tropical Pacific and the Southern Ocean. Shifts in the austral westerlies have global climatic consequences, especially through resulting changes in the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere and altered heat flux from the tropical Pacific into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We suggest that the last glacial termination was a global warming episode that led to extreme seasonality in northern latitudes by stimulating a flush of meltwater and icebergs into the North Atlantic from adjoining ice sheets. This fresh-water influx resulted in widespread North Atlantic sea ice that caused very cold boreal winters, thus amplifying the annual southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the monsoonal rain belts. We further suggest that muted manifestations of the Zealandia Switch mechanism were responsible for smaller, recurring millennial-scale climate oscillations within the last glacial cycle.},

Global rates of marine sedimentation are usually considered to have reached a maximum after 3–4 Ma, driven by enhanced erosion in a variable glacial–interglacial climate. However, a new compilation of seismic data from the marginal seas of Asia now shows that only the Red River reached its historic peak after 4 Ma. Sediment flux from Asia first peaked in the early–middle Miocene (24–11 Ma), well before the initiation of a glacial climate, indicating that rock uplift and especially precipitation are the key controls on erosion, at least over long periods of geologic time. Reconstructions of weathering in East Asia show that faster erosion correlates with more humid, warm climates in the early–middle Miocene, changing to less erosive, drier climates after 14 Ma when Antarctic glaciation begins. Average rates of sedimentation on most east Asian continental margins since 1.8 Ma are 5–6 times less than the modern fluvial flux, implying that the flux to the oceans varies sharply on short timescales and is not always buffered over timescales of ∼104 yr by storage in flood plains.},

We test this model using U-Pb dated detrital zircon grains preserved in Paleogene sedimentary rocks in northern Vietnam and SW China. We applied a series of statistical tests to compare the U-Pb age spectra of the rocks in order to highlight differences and similarities between them and with potential source bedrocks. Monte Carlo mixing models imply that erosion was dominantly derived from the Indochina and Songpan-Garzê Blocks and to a lesser extent the Yangtze Craton. Some of the zircon populations indicate local erosion and sedimentation, but others show close similarity both within northern Vietnam, as well as more widely in the Eocene Jianchuan, Paleocene-Oligocene Simao, and Oligocene-Miocene Yuanjiang basins of China. The presence of younger ({\textless}200 Ma) zircons from the Qamdo Block of Tibet is less easily explicable in terms of recycling by erosion of older sedimentary rocks and implies a regional drainage linking SE Tibet and the South China Sea in the Late Eocene-Oligocene. Detrital zircons from offshore in the South China Sea showed initial local erosion, but with a connection to a river stretching to SE Tibet in the Late Oligocene. A change from regional to local sources in the Early Miocene in the Yuanjiang Basin indicates the timing of disruption of the old drainage driven by regional plateau uplift.},

As well as tectonics, climate is well recognized as a primary control on erosion and the transport of sediment to the ocean. Sediment records from the South China Sea show that strong monsoons are associated with intensified reworking of pre-existing floodplain sediments over millennial timescales. Strong monsoons result in deposition of more altered material that is also delivered at higher rates than during more arid times. Millennial-scale changes in monsoon strength result in changes in the weathering regime but not fast enough to account for the changes seen in the sediments preserved in Asian deltas. Instead monsoon modulated recycling dominates. Over longer time periods ({\textgreater}106 y) strengthening of the monsoon is linked to faster bedrock erosion and increased sediment flux of the ocean. Although this also has an effect on chemical weathering, on long time periods the monsoon is seen to be subsidiary to the effects of global cooling at least since the middle Miocene.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analysis of the late Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal record from western Arabian Sea Site 722 revealed long term trends in the history of oceanography and climate. The modern western Arabian Sea surface waters are highly influenced by the monsoonal wind system. Summer upwelling, a result of southwestern winds, occurs along the coast of Somalia which produces distinct foraminiferal assemblages which are dominated by G. bulloides d'Orbigny. Consequently, variations in the distribution record of G. bulloides through time monitor the upwelling history associated with monsoonal activities. G. bulloides was a minor constituent of the foraminiferal fauna from the bottom of the hole (-14.5 Ma) until about 8.6 Ma ago. Then a rapid shift occurred toward higher values, up to 53\% at 7.4 Ma. We interpret this rapid increase as a major step in the evolution of the monsoonal history. It is either the establishment of the system or at least a strong intensification of the monsoonal winds. At 5.5 Ma a significant drop of the G. bulloides relative abundance occurred which may indicate less upwelling, or alternatively other biota may have been favored in this period. From 5.0 Ma to Recent the G. bulloides record indicates that upwelling has occurred with minor fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Today, upwelling along the Oman margin in the Arabian Sea is governed by the South Asian Monsoon winds. The Oman upwelling results in the formation of an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) spanning across the Arabian Sea and large parts of the Indian Ocean. While these conditions are recorded as early as the middle Miocene ( 15 Ma), the long-term dynamics of upwelling in the Arabian Sea are as of yet poorly constrained during the middle to late Miocene. Here, we use organic and inorganic proxies combined with sedimentary and paleontological records to constrain the evolution of upwelling at Ocean Drilling Program Site 722B between 15 and 8.7 Ma. Our record shows that Mn depletion occurred at 14.5 Ma, likely due to regionally confined OMZ formation at that time. Biogenic silica accumulation intensified between 12.5 and 11 Ma. The δ15N values ({\textgreater}6‰) provide evidence for the onset of at least intermittent denitrification between 11 and 9.5 Ma during the apex of the global “carbonate crash.” Our data demonstrate that upwelling and OMZ intensity in the Arabian Sea were linked to the reorganization of the Indian Ocean circulation system and South Asian Monsoon during the Miocene. The initiation of these systems occurred once the regional tectonic configuration (i.e., the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau 25 Ma and the closure of the Tethyan seaway 20 Ma) was in place. The subsequent development of monsoonal upwelling after 14 Ma responded to latitudinal shifts in climatic belts following the progressive Miocene glaciation of Antarctica.},

	abstract = {The development of the South Asian monsoon (SAM) and Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau uplift were closely intertwined with some studies suggesting that uplift initiated the monsoon whereas others link tectonics with monsoon-controlled exhumation. Silicate weathering controls atmospheric CO2 on geological timescales resulting in a large potential for monsoon strength and the Himalayan orogeny to influence global climate but detailed records of South Asian monsoon-induced weathering on million year (Myr) timescales are lacking. Here we present radiogenic Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope compositions of clay minerals produced by silicate weathering and transported to the central Bay of Bengal. The radiogenic isotope data exhibit a relatively small range and demonstrate a remarkably consistent mixture of sources dominated by Himalayan rocks and the Indo-Burman ranges, which consist of sediments derived from the Himalayas. This suggests that the spatial pattern of regional weathering, which today is highest in the regions of strongest monsoon rains, has persisted in a similar form for the last 27 Myrs. A pronounced increase in primary clay mineral abundance (from 9 to 22 \%) coincident with global cooling 13.9 Myrs ago points to a shift in the weathering regime given that the clay provenance did not change dramatically. Relatively weaker chemical weathering intensity during the mid and late Miocene cooling suggests increased aridity and changes in the large scale atmospheric circulation in the SAM domain. The establishment of the dry winter monsoon season during the mid and late Miocene may have caused this shift in the weathering regime and can reconcile much of the contrasting evidence for SAM initiation.

	abstract = {During the middle Miocene, Earth's climate changed from a global warm period (Miocene Climatic Optimum) into a colder one with the expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet. This prominent climate transition was also a period of drastic changes in global atmospheric circulation. The development of the South Asian monsoon is not well understood and mainly derived from proxy records of wind strength. Data for middle Miocene changes in rainfall are virtually non-existent for India and the Arabian Sea prior to 11 Ma. This study presents planktic foraminiferal trace element (Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca) and stable oxygen isotope records from NGHP-01 Site 01A off the coast of West India in the Eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) to reconstruct the regional surface hydrography and hydroclimate in the South Asian monsoon (SAM) region during the middle Miocene. The Ba/Ca and local seawater δ18O (δ18Osw) changes reveal a notable gradual increase in SAM rainfall intensity during the middle Miocene. Additionally to this long-term increase in precipitation, the seawater δ18O is punctuated by a prominent decrease, i.e. freshening, at 14 Ma contemporary with Antarctic glaciation. This suggests that Southern Ocean Intermediate Waters (SOIW) transmitted Antarctic salinity changes into the Arabian Sea via an “oceanic tunnel” mechanism. The middle Miocene increase in SAM rainfall is consistent with climate model simulations of an overall strengthening Asian monsoon from the Eocene to the middle/late Miocene with a further acceleration after the middle Miocene climate transition.},

The expedition set out to unravel the timing of Neogene climate changes, in particular the evolution of the South Asian monsoon and fluctuations of the sea level. The timing of these changes are assessed by dating resultant sedimentary alterations that mark stratigraphic turning points in the Neogene Maldives platform system. The first four turning points during the early and middle Miocene are related to sea-level changes. These are reliably recorded in the stratigraphy of the carbonate sequences in which sequence boundaries provide the ages of the sea-level lowstand. Phases of aggradational platform growth give precise age brackets of long-term sea-level high stands during the early Miocene and the early to middle Miocene Climate Optimum that is dated here between 17 to 15.1 Ma. The subsequent middle Miocene cooling coincident with the eastern Antarctic ice sheet expansion resulted in a long-term lowering of sea level that is reflected by a progradational platform growth. The change in platform architecture from aggradation to progradation marks this turning point at 15.1 Ma.},

Geochemical proxies used to infer modes of past circulation provide conflicting interpretations for the reorganization of the ocean circulation through the Late Cretaceous. Here, we present climate model simulations of the Cenomanian (100.5–93.9\&thinsp;Ma) and Maastrichtian (72.1–66.1\&thinsp;Ma) stages of the Cretaceous with the CCSM4 earth system model. We focus on intermediate (500–1500\&thinsp;m) and deep (\&gt;\&thinsp;1500\&thinsp;m) ocean circulation and show that while there is continuous deep-water production in the southwestern Pacific, major circulation changes occur between the Cenomanian and Maastrichtian. Opening of the Atlantic and Southern Ocean, in particular, drives a transition from a mostly zonal circulation to enhanced meridional exchange. Using additional experiments to test the effect of deepening of major ocean gateways in the Maastrichtian, we demonstrate that the geometry of these gateways likely had a considerable impact on ocean circulation. We further compare simulated circulation results with compilations of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{ε}$_{\textrm{Nd}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} records and show that simulated changes in Late Cretaceous ocean circulation are reasonably consistent with proxy-based inferences. In our simulations, consistency with the geologic history of major ocean gateways and absence of shift in areas of deep-water formation suggest that Late Cretaceous trends in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{ε}$_{\textrm{Nd}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} values in the Atlantic and southern Indian oceans were caused by the subsidence of volcanic provinces and opening of the Atlantic and Southern oceans rather than changes in deep-water formation areas and/or reversal of deep-water fluxes. However, the complexity in interpreting Late Cretaceous {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{ε}$_{\textrm{Nd}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} values underscores the need for new records as well as specific {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{ε}$_{\textrm{Nd}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} modeling to better discriminate between the various plausible theories of ocean circulation change during this period.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The low-level jet (LLJ) over the Indian region, which is most prominent during the monsoon (June–September) season, has been studied with a general circulation model (GCM). The role of African orography in modulating this jet is the focus of this article. The presence of African orography intensifies the cross-equatorial flow. Contrary to previous modelling studies we find that cross-equatorial flow occurs even in the absence of African orography, though this flow is much weaker even when the Indian monsoon rainfall is high. However, the location of the meridional jet near the equator in the Somali region is linked to the Indian monsoon rainfall rather than to the land–sea contrast over Somalia. Also, the presence of African orography, and not the strength of the Indian monsoon, controls the vertical extent of the equatorial meridional wind. In an aqua-planet simulation, the cross-equatorial flow occurs about 30° to the west of the rainfall maximum. Thus, the longitudinal location of the equatorial Somali jet depends upon the occurrence of monsoon heating, but the vertical structure of the jet is on account of the western boundary current in the atmosphere due to the East African highlands under the influence of monsoonal heat source.

	abstract = {Central Asia has become increasingly arid during the Cenozoic, though the mechanisms behind this aridification remain unresolved. Much attention has focused on the influence and uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the role of ranges linked to India-Asia convergence but well north of the Plateau—including the Altai, Sayan, and Hangay—in creating the arid climate of Central Asia is poorly understood. Today, these ranges create a prominent rain shadow, effectively separat-ing the boreal forest to the north from the deserts of Central Asia. To explore the role of these mountains in modifying climate since the late Eocene, we measured carbon and oxygen stable isotopes in paleosol carbonates from three basins along a 650 km long transect at the northern edge of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia and in the lee of the Altai and Hangay mountains. We combine these data with modern air-parcel back-trajectory modeling to understand regional moisture transport pathways at each basin. In all basins, ␦ 13 C increases, with the largest increase in western Mongolia. The first ␦ 13 C increase occurs in central and southwestern Mongolia in the Oligocene. ␦ 13 C again increases from the upper Miocene to the Quaternary in western and southwest-ern Mongolia. We use a 1-D soil diffusion model to demonstrate that these ␦ 13 C increases are linked to declines in soil respiration driven by dramatic increases in aridity. Using modern-day empirical relations between mean annual precipitation and soil respiration, we estimate that precipitation has likely more than halved over the Neogene. Given the importance of the Hangay and Altai in steering moisture in Mongolia, we attribute these changes to differential surface uplift of the Hangay and Altai. Surface uplift in the Hangay began by the early Oligocene, blocking Siberian moisture and aridifying the northern Gobi. In contrast, surface uplift of the Altai began in the late Miocene, blocking moisture from reaching western Mongolia. Thus, the northern Gobi became increasingly arid east to west since the late Eocene, likely driven by orographic development in the Hangay during the Oligocene and the Altai in the late Miocene through Pliocene.},

Stage one records rapid cooling to the low temperature part of the fission track partial annealing zone circa 70±10 °C. Stage two, records a period of relative stability with little if any cooling taking place between ∼75 and ∼25–20 Ma suggesting the Altai region had been reduced to an area of low relief. Support for this can be found in the adjacent Junngar Basin that received little if any sediment during this interval. Final stage cooling took place in the Miocene at an accelerated rate bringing the sampled rocks to the Earth's surface. This last stage, linked to the far field effects of the Himalayan collision, most likely generated the surface uplift and relief that define the present-day Altai Mountains.},

	abstract = {The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia is a mountainous region covering more than 200,000km2 with numerous flat-topped peaks over 3000m that preserve a Late Cretaceous–Paleogene erosion surface. Doming began in the middle Oligocene producing more than 2000m of regional topographic uplift. The range represents an important kinematic link between the Baikal rift province to the north and Altai transpressional ranges to the south and west. Structural field investigations of major faults visible on satellite imagery indicate that the southern Hangay Dome region is dominated by Late Cenozoic normal faults that bound small half-graben. Most faults are NE-striking and faults at the highest elevations are the most recently active. Most graben appear to be isolated systems that constitute small sediment sinks perched on the flanks and crests of the dome. The first-order feature is the dome itself and most sediment eroded off of the dome is deposited in the Mongolian Valley of Lakes or is carried northwards by the Selenga river and its extensive tributaries. The basement of the dome is a Precambrian craton although the shape and dimensions of the craton are poorly constrained to the north and east. Late Cenozoic uplift of the southern dome region appears to be confined to the area underlain by cratonic basement whereas the Altai region to the south and west is underlain by mechanically weaker Palaeozoic arc and accretionary belts. With respect to the regional northeast directed SHmax, the Hangay craton appears to have acted as a rigid passive indentor focusing Late Cenozoic transpressional deformation around its west and southern margins. Models invoking a Late Cenozoic plume as the driving force for doming and widespread alkaline volcanism on the dome are not strongly supported by geochemical and isotopic data on Neogene–Recent volcanics and the spatial correlation between areas that are domed and older cratonic crust appears too coincidental to be ignored. Convective removal of an overthickened lithospheric root leading to adiabatically decompressed asthenosphere could explain regional doming and volcanism, however major crustal thickening last occurred in the Permian in the southern Hangay region and the time lag between thickening and postulated root removal and plateau uplift ({\textgreater}200Myr) appears too long. An alternative model is explored based on speculated lithospheric mantle flow patterns driven by India's continued northeastward indentation. It is suggested that lithospheric mantle flow diversion around the overthickened Hangay craton crustal keel could cause lithospheric thinning beneath the craton and passive asthenospheric upwarp leading to regional topographic uplift and decompression melting/alkali volcanism. In general, the angular relationship between Precambrian craton boundaries and the prevailing northeasterly SHmax appears to control the kinematics of late Cenozoic deformation throughout the Hangay, Altai, Sayan and Baikal regions.},

	abstract = {Paired apatite ﬁssion track and U-Th/He dates provide the ﬁrst Late Cenozoic cooling ages for the northern Tien Shan. These data clearly argue for pulsed deformation since the Late Miocene, with early (10–11 Ma) and late (0–3 Ma) intervals of rapid exhumation separated by an extended interval of much slower rates. By integrating these bedrock cooling rates with shortening estimates derived from a balanced section, detrital cooling ages, and geomorphological estimates of conditions before deformation, we reconstruct a four-stage history of range growth and exhumation. Following ∼100 m.yr. of tectonic quiescence, abruptly accelerated rock uplift, exhumation, and cooling in the Kyrgyz Range commenced at ∼11 Ma with rates exceeding ∼1 km/m.yr. During the subsequent 7 m.yr., deformation and cooling rates decreased three- to sixfold before accelerating by comparable amounts during the past 3 m.yr. Since mid-Miocene times, the surface elevation of the Kyrgyz Range has increased ∼2 km, consistent with the reconstructed magnitude of crustal shortening (∼11 km) and thickening (∼12 km) across the range. The highly pulsed deformation rates indicate that the locus of deformation probably shifted repeatedly within the Tien Shan from the Miocene to present. Even at their most rapid, Cenozoic shortening rates in the Kyrgyz Range were equivalent to only 10\%–20\% of the modern geodetic convergence rate across the entire Tien Shan. This requires several ranges within the Tien Shan to have deformed simultaneously since the Middle Miocene, a situation analogous to the distributed shortening seen today.},

	abstract = {The dextral Talas-Fergana Fault separates the western from the central Tien Shan. Recent work has shed light on the Cenozoic evolution of the eastern and central Tien Shan; much less attention has been paid to the western Tien Shan. In this contribution we present new thermochronological ages for the Fergana and Alai ranges that, combined with the available data set, constrain the Cenozoic exhumation history of the western Tien Shan. Following a tectonically quiet early Cenozoic period, we suggest an onset of exhumation at 25 Ma. This early onset was followed by a period of slower exhumation and in some areas minor reheating. A final, strong late Miocene rapid cooling event is well represented in the western Tien Shan as in other sectors of the range. The early onset of uplift of the western Tien Shan dissected the previously continuous westernmost Parathethyan Sea, progressively isolating basins (e.g., Fergana, Tarim, and Alai basins) in the central Asian hinterland. Moreover, the coeval timing of late Miocene uplift along the length of entire Tien Shan implies that neither the Pamir nor Tarim can be the sole driver for exhumation of the entire range.},

	abstract = {The Pamir Salient and Southwestern Tien Shan belong to two different systems, which collided due to the continuous northward drift of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic, resulting in a shortening of {\textasciitilde}300km. The uplift history and kinematic evolution of the Pamir-Southwestern Tien Shan remain unclear. In this study, we chose the 2025 m-thick Pakabulake formation in the East Wuqia section, at the southern-most margin of the Southwestern Tien Shan system, to obtain a high-resolution magnetostratigraphic record spanning {\textasciitilde}16.61Ma to {\textasciitilde}9.78Ma. Based on its high sedimentation rate, stable ca. E-W paleocurrents and stable magnetic susceptibility values, the nearby Southwestern Tien Shan was inferred to have undergone stable uplift during this period of sedimentation. Combining our results with the previous low-temperature thermochronology, magnetostratigraphy and re-calculated block rotations, we conclude that four episodic uplift events occurred in the Pamir-Southwestern Tien Shan during the Cenozoic, at times of {\textasciitilde}50–40Ma, {\textasciitilde}35–16Ma, {\textasciitilde}11–7Ma and {\textless}5Ma, and that the first episodic uplift only occurred in the Pamir Salient. In addition, the Pamir Salient underwent a tectonic transformation from entire- to a half-oroclinal bending rotation during the Miocene, caused by activity along the Karakorum Fault and Kashgar-Yecheng Transfer System.},

	abstract = {Along the Ghissar-Alai Range of the southwestern Tian Shan (southwestern Kyrgyzstan, northern Tajikistan), the deformation front of the India-Asia collision—the Pamir-Tibet orogen—is interacting with the intracontinental Tian Shan orogen without the intervening Tarim Craton. Apatite fission track (n = 33, 3.3–145.6 Ma, 27\% {\textless}10 Ma) and (U-Th)/He (n = 32, 1.9–26.1 Ma, 56\% {\textless}10 Ma) thermochronologic ages suggest approximate isothermal holding (very slow cooling to weak reheating) during relative tectonic quiescence between 150 and 15 Ma. Accelerated exhumation ( 0.2–1.0 km/Myr, median 0.5 km/Myr) and cooling (11–16°C/Myr) occurred over the last 10 Myr. Geomorphologic parameters—incision, river steepness, and concavity—confirm the youth of the southwestern Tian Shan's mountain building. High exhumation/cooling rates are correlated with pronounced local relief, produced by Cenozoic faults reactivating inherited (Late Paleozoic) structures. Regions with similarly young exhumation are centered along rims of rigid crustal blocks in the central and eastern Tian Shan. Structurally, the Ghissar-Alai Range is a broad, east trending zone of dextral transpression that includes the northern Tajik Basin (Illiak Fault Zone) and the Pamir Thrust System of the frontal northern Pamir. It is the particular deformation field at the northwestern tip of the India-Asia collision—the interaction of the westward gravitational collapse of the Pamir Plateau into the Tajik Basin with the bulk northward motion of the Pamir—that transformed the southwestern Tian Shan into a dextral transpression belt. The dextral transpression in the southwestern Tian Shan contrasts with sinistral strike-slip shear localized along inherited fault zones, accommodating dominant north-south shortening, in the central and eastern Tian Shan. The deformation field influenced by the Pamir and the associated young exhumation make the Ghissar-Alai Range a unique feature in the Tian Shan orogen.},

Based on growth strata and age determination, we show that syntectonic growth strata began to develop in the middle part of Tian Shan since 6 Ma ago. Geometry analysis indicates that formation of the growth strata is associated with progressive fold-limb rotation. Formation of the growth strata is contemporaneous with the tectonic deformation in the thrusting and folding zones. Together with the remarkable increase of sedimentation rate as well as the accumulation of coarse molasse deposits, we conclude that the late Cenozoic crustal shortening and mountain building in the region initiated since about 6 Ma and lasted to the early Pleistocene, as a consequence of intracontinental deformation within the India–Eurasia convergent system.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the active tectonics of central Asia based on an interpretation of Landsat imagery and supplemented with published field observations and seismic data. Reverse faulting dominates the tectonics of the Tien Shan but is associated with prominent northwest trending right lateral strike slip fault systems. Both types of faulting imply approximately north-south maximum compressive stress. The active tectonics of the Altai and of southern Mongolia are controlled by largescale conjugate strike slip faulting; left lateral on east-west planes and right lateral on north-northwest planes. This implies that the maximum compressive stress is oriented approximately northeast-southwest. Farther north, strike slip faulting gives way to predominantly normal faulting in the Baykal rift system. We interpret all of the active faulting to be a consequence of lateral displacements of the crust caused by the penetration of the Indian subcontinent of Eurasia. We also interpret the gradual change from thrust faulting and high altitudes in the south and west to normal faulting and lower mean elevations in the north and east to reflect a smooth change in the average state of stress. This suggests that the details of the complex intracontinental deformation in Asia are better described by the deformation of a continuum than by the relative motion of a small number of rigid blocks. Intracontinental rifting in the northeast, in particular, may result from a state of stress analogous to the secondary tension that commonly arises within bounded plastic materials indented by a rigid die.},

	abstract = {During the Mesozoic, the active southern margin of Eurasia was the site of several accretion and collision events that fit into a framework of convergence between Eurasia and advancing (peri-) Gondwanan units. Far-field effects of the Mesozoic Mongol–Okhotsk and Cimmerian orogenies have been recorded deep within the interior of Eurasia. Convergence finally culminated in the massive India–Eurasia continent–continent collision in the Early Cenozoic. This collision, continued convergence between both continents, and resulting ongoing indentation of India into Eurasia have dominated the geological, tectonic and geodynamic evolution of Eurasia. Amongst others, distant effects of these events have reactivated an array of mobile belts in Central Asia. Apatite fission-track dating and thermal history modeling performed on samples from the Kyrgyz Tien Shan and Siberian Altai Mountains record both Mesozoic deformation and Cenozoic reactivation of intracontinental Eurasia. The onset of the building and growth of the modern Tien Shan and Altai orogens is constrained to the Late Miocene and Pliocene, with a likely trend of activity younger towards the north. This would underscore the general model that deformation related to India–Eurasia convergence was progressively propagated northwards through Central Asia via the inherited structural fabric of the Eurasian crust.},

	abstract = {Lake Issyk-Kul occupies a large Late Mesozoic–Cenozoic intramontane basin between the mountain ranges of the Northern Kyrgyz Tien Shan. These ranges are often composed of granitoid basement that forms part of a complex mosaic assemblage of microcontinents and volcanic arcs. Several granites from the Terskey, Kungey, Trans-Ili and Zhetyzhol Ranges were dated with the zircon U/Pb method (SHRIMP, LA-ICP-MS) and yield concordant Late Ordovician–Silurian ({\textasciitilde}456–420Ma) emplacement ages. These constrain the “Caledonian” accretion history of the Northern Kyrgyz Tien Shan in the amalgamated Palaeo-Kazakhstan continent. The ancestral Tien Shan orogen assembled in the Early Permian when final closure of the Turkestan Ocean ensued collision of Palaeo-Kazakhstan and Tarim. A Late Palaeozoic structural basement fabric formed and Middle–Late Permian post-collisional magmatism added to crustal growth of the Tien Shan. Permo‐Triassic cooling ({\textasciitilde}300–220Ma) of the ancestral Tien Shan was unraveled using 40Ar/39Ar K-feldspar and titanite fission-track (FT) thermochronology on the Issyk-Kul granitoids. Apatite thermochronology (FT and U–Th–Sm/He) applied to the broader Issyk-Kul region elucidates the Meso-Cenozoic thermo-tectonic evolution and constrains several tectonic reactivation episodes in the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cenozoic. Exhumation of the studied units occurred during a protracted period of intracontinental orogenesis, linked to far-field effects of Late Jurassic–Cretaceous accretion of peri-Gondwanan blocks from the Tethyan realm to Eurasian. Following a subsequent period of stability and peneplanation, incipient building of the modern Tien Shan orogen in Northern Kyrgyzstan started in the Oligocene according to our data. Intense basement cooling in distinct reactivated and fault-controlled sections of the Trans-Ili and Terskey Ranges finally pinpoint important Miocene–Pliocene ({\textasciitilde}22–5Ma) exhumation of the Issyk-Kul basement. Late Cenozoic formation of the Tien Shan is associated with ongoing indentation of India into Eurasia and is a quintessential driving force for the reactivation of the entire Central Asian Orogenic Belt.},

	abstract = {The geological history of the Burmese subduction margin, where India obliquely subducts below Indochina, remains poorly documented although it is key to deciphering geodynamic models for the evolution of the broader Tibetan-Himalayan orogen. Various scenarios for the evolution of the orogen have been proposed, including a collision of India with Myanmar in the Paleogene, a significant extrusion of Myanmar and Indochina from the India-Asia collision zone, or very little change in paleogeography and subduction regime since the India-Asia collision. This article examines the history of the Burmese forearc basin, with a particular focus on Eocene–Oligocene times to reconstruct the evolution of the Burmese margin during the early stages of the India-Asia collision. We report on sedimentological, geochemical, petrographical, and geochronological data from the Chindwin Basin—the northern part of the Burmese forearc—and integrate these results with previous data from other basins in central Myanmar.Our results show that the Burmese margin acted as a regular Andean-type subduction margin until the late middle Eocene, with a forearc basin that was open to the trench and fed by the denudation of the Andean volcanic arc to the east. We show that the modern tectonic configuration of central Myanmar formed 39–37 million years ago, when the Burmese margin shifted from an Andean-type margin to a hyper-oblique margin. The forearc basin was quickly partitioned into individual pull-apart basins, bounded to the west by a quickly emerged accretionary prism, and to the east by synchronously exhumed basement rocks, including coeval high-grade metamorphics. We interpret this shift as resulting from the onset of strike-slip deformation on the subduction margin leading to the formation of a paleo-sliver plate, with a paleo fault system in the accretionary prism, pull-apart basins in the forearc, and another paleo fault system in the backarc. This evolution implies that hyper-oblique convergence below the Burmese margin is at least twice older than previously thought. Our results reject any India-Asia convergence scenario involving an early Paleogene collision of India with Myanmar. In contrast, our results validate conservative geodynamic models arguing for a close-to-modern pre-collisional paleogeometry for the Indochina Peninsula, and indicate that any post-collisional rotation of Indochina, if it occurred at all, must have been achieved by the late middle Eocene.},

However, the timing of this collision and its correlation to regional uplift phases, sedimentary provenance, and basin development remain poorly constrained. We report sedimentological, paleomagnetic, and geochronological data from the late Eocene to early Miocene strata of the Chindwin Basin in the Burmese forearc, constraining the paleogeographic evolution of the Burma Terrane and the Eastern Himalayan orogen. Our results highlight two unconformities of late Eocene-middle Oligocene and latest Oligocene-early Miocene age, revealing a two-stage interaction of the Burma Terrane with the Asian margin during its northward translation. The first unconformity follows rapid 0.6 m/ky subsidence in the Burmese forearc, as shown by magnetostratigraphy. The transition to a fluvial depositional environment and the occurrence of reworked sediments at this first unconformity likely records the commencing collision of India and the northern extent of the Burma Terrane with the Asian margin. The second unconformity shows drastic changes in magnetic properties, mineralogy, and provenance, with high-grade metamorphic grains and early Miocene apatite U-Pb and fission-track ages indicating that it is coeval to a major deformation phase in Myanmar and the Eastern Himalayan orogen. It likely records the indentation of the Burma Terrane into the Eastern Himalayan collision zone, forming the modern Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis.},

	abstract = {The Indo-Burman Ranges (IBR) are a mountain range comprised of Mesozoic-Cenozoic rocks which run the length of Western Myanmar, extending into India and Bangladesh; to the west lies the Indian Ocean, and to the east lies the Central Myanmar Basin (CMB) along which the Irrawaddy River flows. The IBR are considered to be an accretionary prism, developed at the juncture of the Indian and Sunda plates, and a number of hypotheses have been proposed for their evolution. However, in order for these hypotheses to be evaluated, the timing of IBR evolution needs to be determined. We undertook a two-pronged approach to determining the timing of uplift of the IBR. (1) We present the first low-temperature thermochronological age elevation profiles of the IBR using ZFT, AFT and ZHe techniques. Our data show: a major period of exhumation occurred around the time of the Oligo-Miocene boundary; we tentatively suggest, subject to further verification, an additional period of exhumation at or before the late Eocene. (2) We carried out a detailed multi-technique provenance study of the sedimentary rocks of the IBR and Arakan Coastal region to their west, and compared data to coeval rocks of the CMB. We determined that during Eocene times, rocks of the CMB and IBR were derived from similar local provenance, that of the Myanmar arc to the east. Therefore at this time there was an open connection from arc to ocean. By contrast, by Miocene times, provenance diverged. Rocks of the CMB were deposited by a through-flowing Irrawaddy River, with detritus derived from its upland source region of the Mogok Metamorphic Belt and Cretaceous-Paleogene granites to the north. Such a provenance is not recorded in coeval rocks of the IBR, indicating that the IBR had uplifted by this time, providing a barrier to transport of material to the west. To the previously published list of viable proposals to explain the exhumation of the range, we add a new suggestion: the period of exhumation around the time of the Oligo-Miocene boundary could have been governed by a change to wedge dynamics instigated by a major increase in the thickness of the incoming Bengal Fan sediment pile.},

	abstract = {Located at the southern edge of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, the Central Myanmar Basin (CMB) is divided into several Tertiary sub-basins that have been almost continuously ﬁlled since the IndoAsia collision. They are currently drained by the Irrawaddy River, which ﬂows down the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the Sino-Burman Ranges. Tracing sediment provenance from the CMB is thus critical for reconstructing the past denudation of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen; it is especially relevant since a popular drainage scenario involves the capture of the Tsangpo drainage system in Tibet by a precursor to the Irrawaddy River. Here, we document the provenance of sediment samples from the Minbu Sub-Basin at the southern edge of the CMB, which is traversed by the modern stream of the Irrawaddy River. Samples ranging in age from middle Eocene to Pleistocene were investigated using Nd isotopes, trace element geochemistry and sandstone modal compositions. Our data provide no evidence of a dramatic provenance shift; however, sandstone petrography, trace element ratios and isotopic values display long-term trends indicating a gradual decrease of the volcanic input and its replacement by a dominant supply from the Burmese basement. These trends are interpreted to reﬂect the progressive denudation of the Andean-type volcanic arc that extended onto the Burmese margin, along the ﬂank of the modern Sino-Burman Ranges, where most of the post-collisional deformation of central Myanmar is located. Though our results do not exclude an ephemeral or diluted contribution from a past Tsangpo-Irrawaddy connection, sedimentation rates suggest that this hypothesis is unlikely before the development of a stable Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River in the Miocene. These results thus suggest that the central Myanmar drainage basin has remained restricted to the Sino-Burman Ranges since the beginning of the India-Asia collision.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a structural and kinematics analysis of the Indo-Burmese Wedge based on seismic reflection, geodetic, and geological field data. We found out that the Indo-Burmese Wedge is the place of diffuse strain partitioning: right-lateral shearing in the innermost part and E-W shortening in the outermost part. In the outer wedge, thick-skinned deformation overprints thin-skinned deformation. It can be explained by the required preservation of the critical taper after the fast westward propagation of the outer wedge above a very efficient clayey décollement layer. The thick-skinned deformation is here characterized by major right-lateral strike-slip faults (the Kaladan Fault and the Chittagong Coastal Fault) and yet a typical internal deformation of the Indo-Burmese Wedge. We suggest that the westward migration of internal right-lateral shear deformation allows preservation of the strain-partitioning ratios between internal N-S trending right-lateral shearing and external E-W shortening. Some seismic lines show that the outer wedge deformation is not older than 2 Ma. Its propagation could have been enhanced by the large amount of sediments filling up the Sylhet flexural basin formed after the Pliocene tectonic uplift of the Shillong Plateau.},

	abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau is the type example of a large orogenic plateau formed as a result of continent-continent collision. The morphology of the plateau and its margins suggests that preexisting variations in crustal strength have influenced the growth of the plateau. We have developed a three-dimensional numerical model of deformation in a viscous crust in order to investigate the effects of lateral heterogeneities on plateau growth. The model includes a two layer crust and allows for lateral variation of viscosity in both the upper and lower layers. Model results indicate that crustal strength variations have a dramatic effect on the morphology and dynamics of a developing plateau. A region of strong crust is characterized by a very steep plateau margin that propagates extremely slowly, does not accommodate significant shortening strain, and is subparallel to local upper and lower crustal velocities. A weak crustal region develops a gently sloping margin; uplift propagates rapidly across the weak zone, and crustal material within the plateau is diverted toward the low-strength region. With a relatively simple distribution of strength variations, corresponding to strong Tarim and Sichuan Basin crust and a weak southeastern corner, our model produces a plateau with many similarities to the Tibetan Plateau, including the overall morphology, rotation around the eastern syntaxis, and E–W extension. Analysis of model results suggests that E–W extension of the central plateau may be related to the rapid eastward flow of crustal material into a weak zone in the SE corner without significant change in plateau elevation.},

After collision about 50 million years ago, crust was shortened in western and central Tibet, while large fragments of lithosphere moved from the collision zone toward areas of trench rollback in the western Pacific and Indonesia. Cessation of rapid Pacific trench migration (∼15 to 20 million years ago) coincided with a slowing of fragment extrusion beyond the plateau and probably contributed to the onset of rapid surface uplift and crustal thickening in eastern Tibet. The latter appear to result from rapid eastward flow of the deep crust, probably within crustal channels imaged seismically beneath eastern Tibet.

Stepwise thermal and alternating field demagnetization isolated a linear magnetization component that decays univectorally toward the origin and likely represents a primary magnetization principally carried by magnetite. From this component, 29 magnetic polarity intervals were identified. They correlate between ∼3.1 and ∼10.5 Ma with the reference magnetic polarity time scale, indicating a relatively constant sedimentation rate with an average of 0.21±0.01 mm/year. We also performed a suite of rock magnetic experiments designed to track time-transgressive changes in the sedimentary record.

	abstract = {The present-day topography of the Tian Shan range is considered to result from crustal shortening related to the ongoing India-Asia collision that started in the early Tertiary. In this study we report evidence for several episodes of localized tectonic activity which occurred prior to that major orogenic event. Apatite fission track analysis and (U-Th)/He dating on apatite and zircon indicate that inherited Paleozoic structures were reactivated in the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic during a Cimmerian orogenic episode and also in the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene (around 65–60 Ma). These reactivations could have resulted from the accretion of the Kohistan-Dras arc or lithospheric extension in the Siberia-Mongolia zone. Activity resumed in the late Mesozoic prior to the major Tertiary orogenic phase. Finally, the ongoing deformation, which again reactivates inherited tectonic structures, tends to propagate inside the endoreic basins that were preserved in the range, leading to their progressive closure. This study demonstrates the importance of inherited structures in localizing the first increments of the deformation before it propagates into yet undeformed areas.},

	abstract = {Standing over 2km above the surrounding topography and flanked by orogen-scale strike-slip faults, the Hangay Dome in central Mongolia is characterized by long wavelength high topography, basaltic eruptions spanning 30million years, and an abundance of flat-topped summit plateaus. However, despite decades of research, the origin and timing of the intraplate Hangay Dome uplift continues to be debated. Using Landsat imagery, GIS, and cosmogenic beryllium-10, we employ geomorphic investigations of (1) paleotopography preserved beneath basalt flows of known age, (2) erosion rates at various temporal scales, and (3) the relative contribution of glacial activity to total erosion to provide insight into the nature of landscape evolution in the Egiin Davaa region of the central Hangay Dome since the middle Miocene. Reconstruction of paleo-valleys cut into Paleozoic basement rock that exhibit a degree of local relief ({\textgreater}600m) similar to the modern landscape, sluggish mean erosion rates ({\textless}45mMyr−1), and dominance of glacial erosion suggest that there has been no dramatic change in tectonic forcing of the study area since ∼13Ma, and that high amplitude climate oscillations beginning in the Pliocene have led to an environment influenced primarily by the activity of glaciers. These results provide support for uplift onset during the Oligocene or early Miocene, quantify landscape evolution since the middle Miocene, and underscore the importance of considering geomorphic archives found on Earth’s surface when building models of intra-continental epeirogeny.},

	abstract = {A sedimentologic, petrologic, and geochemical evaluation of lacustrine carbonates from the Eocene-Oligocene Fenghuoshan Group of north-central Tibet provides insight into the paleoenvironmental and paleolimnological setting of the Hoh Xil basin during the mid-Tertiary. Fenghuoshan lacustrine rocks consist primarily of carbonate mudstones and wackestones. These carbonates are generally less than 3 m in thickness and are intercalated with siliciclastic lacustrine and ﬂuvial/alluvial plain deposits. Individual limestone beds coarsen and contain increasing amounts of siliciclastic material upward. Fenghuoshan carbonates also contain abundant ostracode, bivalve, and charaphyte fossils. Sedimentologic evidence suggests that carbonate deposition occurred in shallow, relatively short-lived lacustrine systems that were subsequently ﬁlled by alluvial deposits of coeval ﬂuvial systems. Stable C and O isotopic analysis of Fenghuoshan carbonates show d18O values ranging from Ϫ11.7‰ to Ϫ10.3‰ (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite [VPDB]) and d13C values between Ϫ7.1‰ and Ϫ2.2‰ (VPDB). The lack of correlation between the two isotopic systems supports the sedimentological interpretation of a shallow, hydrologically open lacustrine setting during the time of carbonate deposition. This interpretation is reinforced by the mineralogy and Mg/Ca molar ratios from Fenghuoshan lacustrine carbonates that indicate fresh water conditions. In addition, petrographic analysis and the d18O composition of samples suggest that Fenghuoshan lacustrine rocks have not undergone signiﬁcant diagenetic alteration. Collectively, these data indicate that the isotopic composition of Fenghuoshan Group carbonates may be used to infer the oxygen isotopic composition of meteoric water feeding these lacustrine basins at the time of deposition, from which we derive estimates of the paleoaltimetry of north-central Tibet during Middle Eocene time. Model results using the isotopic data from Fenghuoshan carbonates indicate that the hypsometric mean elevation of the drainage basins feeding Hoh Xil lakes was Շ2 km. Together with estimates of the Eocene paleoaltimetry from the Lunpola basin to the south, these results provide the ﬁrst direct evidence for the differential uplift of the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.},

	abstract = {We present a new stratigraphy of the Jianchuan basin, one of the largest Cenozoic sedimentary basins in southeastern Tibet. This basin was regarded as recording sedimentation from the Eocene up to the Pliocene, and as such has been the focus of several studies aiming at constraining the environmental, tectonic and topographic evolution of the area. Within the Shuanghe and Jianchuan formations thirteen new zircon U/Pb ages and one biotite 40Ar/39Ar age of interbedded and cross-cutting ultrapotassic magmatic rocks show that a brief magmatic event occurred from {\textasciitilde}35.7 to {\textasciitilde}34.5Ma (35.2±0.4Ma on average). The uppermost formation (Jianchuan Fm), supposedly Pliocene in age, is related to this magmatic event and is 35.4±0.8Ma old. All sedimentary formations are thus Eocene in age, with neither Oligocene nor Miocene sediments. The coal-bearing Shuanghe Formation yields a fossil of a large amynodontid typical of the Upper Eocene Ergilian interval (37.2 to 33.9Ma). Sedimentation of the Shuanghe Formation took place in a short time interval at {\textasciitilde}35.9±0.9Ma, after a large-scale drainage reorganization that induced the abandonment of a large braided-river system. This reorganization was possibly linked with the initiation of the left-lateral Ailao-Shan Red River fault and/or to widespread magmatism in the Jianchuan basin. Previous high paleoaltitude estimates for the Jianchuan basin are thoroughly re-evaluated and yield a value of 1200±1200m.a.s.l. for the Upper Eocene.},

	abstract = {This overview paper considers the East African rift system (EARS) as an intra-continental ridge system, comprising an axial rift. It describes the structural organization in three branches, the overall morphology, lithospheric cross-sections, the morphotectonics, the main tectonic features—with emphasis on the tension fractures—and volcanism in its relationships with the tectonics. The most characteristic features in the EARS are narrow elongate zones of thinned continental lithosphere related to asthenospheric intrusions in the upper mantle. This hidden part of the rift structure is expressed on the surface by thermal uplift of the rift shoulders. The graben valleys and basins are organized over a major failure in the lithospheric mantle, and in the crust comprise a major border fault, linked in depth to a low angle detachment fault, inducing asymmetric roll-over pattern, eventually accompanied by smaller normal faulting and tilted blocks. Considering the kinematics, divergent movements caused the continent to split along lines of preexisting lithospheric weaknesses marked by ancient tectonic patterns that focus the extensional strain. The hypothesis favored here is SE-ward relative divergent drifting of a not yet well individualized Somalian plate, a model in agreement with the existence of NW-striking transform and transfer zones. The East African rift system comprises a unique succession of graben basins linked and segmented by intracontinental transform, transfer and accommodation zones. In an attempt to make a point on the rift system evolution through time and space, it is clear that the role of plume impacts is determinant. The main phenomenon is formation of domes related to plume effect, weakening the lithosphere and, long after, failure inducing focused upper mantle thinning, asthenospheric intrusion and related thermal uplift of shoulders. The plume that had formed first at around 30Ma was not in the Afar but likely in Lake Tana region (Ethiopia), its almost 1000km diameter panache weakening the lithosphere and preparing the later first rifting episode along a preexisting weak zone, a Pan-African suture zone bordering the future Afar region. From the Afar, the rift propagated afterward from north to south on the whole, with steps of local lithospheric failure nucleations along preexisting weak zones. These predisposed lines are mainly suture zones, in which partial activation of low angle detachment faults reworked former thrust faults verging in opposite directions, belonging to double verging ancient belts. This is responsible for eventual reversal in rift asymmetry from one basin to the next. Supposing the plume migrated southward, or other plumes emplaced, the rift could propagate following former weaknesses, even outside areas influenced by plumes. This view of rift formation reconciles the classical models: active plume effect triggered the first ruptures; passive propagations of failure along lithospheric scale weak zones were responsible for the onset of the main rift segments. Various other aspects are shortly considered, such as tectonics and sedimentation, and relationships of the ‘cradle of Mankind’ with human evolution. By its size, structure and occurrence of oceanic lithosphere in the Afar, the EARS can be taken as a model of the prelude of oceanic opening inside a continent.},

	abstract = {It is now generally accepted that continental flood basalt (CFB) volcanism bears a strong relationship with continental breakup. The Ethiopian Afar plume has been linked to the opening of the Afar depression. Propagation of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifts within the depression, still an ongoing process, has rifted away the Ethiopian and Yemenite trap sequences. They are in some locations more than 2 km thick and comprise a wide range of volcanic products, from tholeiitic basalts, in the lower part, to more acidic material in the upper part. Recent studies have established that the bulk of trap volcanism erupted about 30 Ma ago over a period of 1 Myr in the Ethiopian sections, while ages obtained on the Yemenite sections seem more distributed through time. Here, for the first time in a single study, we present geochronological results obtained for basalts and more evolved products for both Ethiopian and Yemenite traps. This approach eliminates inter-laboratory biases and discrepancies in the ages of standards, and imposes better constraints on the eruptive chronology of this CFB province. In addition, both the K–Ar and 40Ar/39Ar techniques have been applied simultaneously, in order to demonstrate that similar ages are indeed obtained for undisturbed samples. The two dating techniques used here yield concordant ages for most samples. On both sides of the Afar depression, our results support that the onset of basaltic volcanism is coeval, with undistinguishable ages of 30.6±0.4 and 30.2±0.4 Ma obtained from Ethiopia and Yemen, respectively. Most of the basaltic lava pile has been erupted in less than 1 Myr, but acidic volcanism seems more spread out through time. It is coeval with basalts in northern Ethiopia but extends to about 26 Ma in Yemen, as already recognized. A younger rhyolitic episode, probably related to the major 20 Ma phase of opening of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as expressed in the Afar depression, is also observed in Yemen and central Ethiopia.},

	abstract = {Models for the formation of the archetypal rift–rift–rift triple junction in the Afar depression have assumed the synchronous development of the Red Sea–Aden–East African rift systems soon after flood basaltic magmatism at 31 Ma, but the timing of intial rifting in the northern sector of the East African rift system had been poorly constrained. The aims of our field, geochronology, and remote sensing studies were to determine the timing and kinematics of rifting in the 3rd arm, the Main Ethiopian rift (MER), near its intersection with the southern Red Sea rift. New structural data and 10 new SCLF 40Ar/39Ar dates show that extension in the northern Main Ethiopian rift commenced after 11 Ma, more than 17 My after initial rifting in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The triple junction, therefore, could have developed only during the past 11 My, or 20 My after the flood basaltic magmatism. Thus, the flood basaltic magmatism and separation of Arabia from Africa are widely separated in time from the opening of the Main Ethiopian rift, which marks the incipient Nubia–Somalia plate boundary; triple junction formation is not a primary feature of breakup above the Afar mantle plume. The East African rift system appears to have propagated northward from the Mesozoic Anza rift system into the Afar depression to cut across Oligo-Miocene rift structures of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, in response to global plate reorganisations. Structural patterns reveal a change from 130°E-directed extension to 105°E-directed extension sometime in the interval 6.6 to 3 Ma, consistent with predictions from global plate kinematic studies. The along-axis propagation of rifting in each of the three arms of the triple junction has led to a NE-migration of the triple junction since 11 Ma.},

	abstract = {We studied two boreholes (Cserépváralja-1 and Kiscell-1) with continuous sedimentary records across the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition from the Central Paratethyan area. Assemblages of benthic foraminifera display a shift in dominance by epifaunal taxa in the late Eocene to shallow and deep infaunal taxa in the early Oligocene. Using the benthic foraminiferal oxygen index (BFOI), a decreasing trend of bottom-water oxygen levels is established across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), leading to the development of dysoxic conditions later in the early Oligocene. Trends in δ18O and δ13C values measured on tests of selected benthic and planktic foraminifera roughly parallel those of the global record of stepped EOT δ18O increase and deviate only later in the early Oligocene, related to the isolation of the Paratethys. The overall similarity of the isotope curves and the presence of a planktic-benthic ecological offset suggest that the original isotope trends are preserved, despite the systematically more negative δ18O values. Of different scenarios, a quasi-uniform diagenetic overprint by fluids with low δ18O values, during burial or uplift, appears best supported. We conclude that the globally established isotopic expression of Antarctic ice sheet growth across the EOT may be recognizable in the Paratethys. Deviations from the global trends after the EOT were caused by regional paleoceanographic changes induced by the progressing Alpine orogeny and sea-level change, which led to a restricted connection with the open ocean, freshwater influx from increased precipitation, and gradual development of bottom-water oxygen depletion.},

	abstract = {The reconstruction and interpretation of terrestrial ecosystems and vegetational patterns in the Central European Miocene have to take into account the influence of a vast landlocked water body, namely the Paratethys Sea. As a northern appendage of the early Mediterranean Sea, it spanned a north–south gradient of at least 4° latitude and has been suggested to represent some kind of “palaeothermometer”, which reflected slight expansions or restrictions of climatic belts. Due to its vulnerable marine connections it was also highly susceptible to major (global) sea-level fluctuations which are reflected in phases of endemism. Hence, a fairly continuous record of marine nearshore assemblages throughout the Miocene reflects an extraordinary interplay of sea-level fluctuations, changes in climate, immigrations, and blooms in autochthonous elements. Whilst biostratigraphic implications of these patterns were recognised early in palaeontology, a biogeographic model is still lacking. The intermingling of palaeogeographic terms with those restricted to biogeography is still commonly used — a situation which can be overcome by integrating data from different biota into a new palaeobiogeographic scheme. Herein, a data-set of 1809 species-level taxa (Gastropoda and Foraminifera) serves as the base for interpretations. Gastropods in particular turned out to be of greatest value for the differentiation of palaeobiogeographic units due to sensitive reactions to all environmental parameters and occupying a wide range of ecological niches. Based on the excellent gastropod record the Proto-Danubian Province, Early Danubian P., Danubian P., Balatonian P. and a Proto-Caspian Subprovince are defined. The biogeographic reorganisations are associated with five major biotic events within the gastropod faunas. These “big five” comprise four extinctions – the late Ottnangian extinction event (LOEE), the mid-Badenian-extinction-event (MBEE), the Badenian–Sarmatian-extinction event (BSEE), the Sarmatian–Pannonian-extinction event (SPEE) – and one exceptional immigration/origination event termed the early Badenian Build-up event (EBBE). Foraminifera are less valuable for palaeobiogeographic purposes in the area and time-slice studied. Endemisms are generally lower and turn-over rates less dramatic. They are, however, very useful for stratigraphic correlations with the Mediterranean and Atlantic areas. This fairly well calibrated marine biostratigraphy of the Central Paratethys serves as stratigraphic backbone and control for continental stratigraphy.},

Stable isotopic compositions of the tooth enamel of large, water-dependent, herbivorous terrestrial mammals are investigated here to better understand the European continental climate during the late Eocene–early Oligocene. High δ18OPO4 and δ13C values reflect a semiarid climate and ecosystem in the late Eocene. In the west-southwest region of Europe, these conditions prevailed until at least 33 Ma, after which it became more humid. A similar change was recorded north of the Alpine thrust, but it occurred 2 m.y. earlier. The north and west-southwest regions show a significant offset in δ18OPO4 composition between 35 and 31 Ma, indicating the influence of different air trajectories with different moisture sources (Atlantic versus Tethys). This also marks the presence of an orographic height in central Europe from the latest Eocene. After 31 Ma, a large drop in δ18OPO4 is registered, explained by altitude-induced fractionation on meteoric water isotopic composition. The related paleoaltitude change is estimated to be 1200 m, and the uplift could have taken place along the Alpine-Dinaridic orogenic system.},

The origin of modern rainforests can be traced to the aftermath of the bolide impact at the end of the Cretaceous. Carvalho et al. used fossilized pollen and leaves to characterize the changes that took place in northern South American forests at this time (see the Perspective by Jacobs and Currano). They not only found changes in species composition but were also able to infer changes in forest structure. Extinctions were widespread, especially among gymnosperms. Angiosperm taxa came to dominate the forests over the 6 million years of recovery, when the flora began to resemble that of modern lowland neotropical forest. The leaf data also imply that the forest canopy evolved from relatively open to closed and layered, leading to increased vertical stratification and a greater diversity of plant growth forms.
Science, this issue p. 63; see also p. 28
The end-Cretaceous event was catastrophic for terrestrial communities worldwide, yet its long-lasting effect on tropical forests remains largely unknown. We quantified plant extinction and ecological change in tropical forests resulting from the end-Cretaceous event using fossil pollen ({\textgreater}50,000 occurrences) and leaves ({\textgreater}6000 specimens) from localities in Colombia. Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) rainforests were characterized by an open canopy and diverse plant–insect interactions. Plant diversity declined by 45\% at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary and did not recover for {\textasciitilde}6 million years. Paleocene forests resembled modern Neotropical rainforests, with a closed canopy and multistratal structure dominated by angiosperms. The end-Cretaceous event triggered a long interval of low plant diversity in the Neotropics and the evolutionary assembly of today’s most diverse terrestrial ecosystem.

Here we present a 1,656-years (5-years-resolution) mean annual precipitation record reconstructed by fossil pollen assemblages from the annually laminated sediments of a lake in the TP interior. The record reveals three dominant cycles, with lengths of ?200-, ?88-, and ?60-years, associated with changes in the Westerlies and the Asian monsoon.

	title = {Climate and geological change as drivers of {Mauritiinae} palm biogeography},
	doi = {10.1111/jbi.14098},
	abstract = {Aim
Forest composition and distribution are determined by a myriad of factors, including climate. As models of tropical rain forest, palms are often used as indicator taxa, particularly the Mauritiinae. We question, what characterizes the Mauritiinae pollen in the global fossil record? And when did the Mauritiinae become endemic to South America?

Location
Global tropics.

Taxon
Mauritiinae palms (Arecaceae: Lepidocaryeae).

Methods
Pollen trait data from extinct and extant Mauritiinae pollen were generated from light‐, scanning‐, and transmission electron microscopy. Statistical morphometric analysis was used to define species and their relationships to other Mauritiinae. We also compiled a comprehensive pollen database for extinct and extant Mauritiinae and mapped their global geographical distribution from Late Cretaceous to present, using GBIF and fossil data.

Results
Our morphometric analysis identified 18 species (11 extinct and seven extant), all exhibiting exine indentations, a synapomorphy of the subtribe. The fossil taxa and early divergent extant Lepidocaryum are all monosulcate, whereas the extant Mauritia and Mauritiella species are all monoulcerate. Paleobiogeographical maps of fossil Mauritiinae pollen occurrences suggest the taxon originated in equatorial Africa during the Cretaceous, and expanded their range to South America, and to India in the Paleocene. Range retraction started in the early Eocene with extirpation from India, and reduction in diversity in Africa culminating at the Eocene–Oligocene Transition (EOT). In contrast, in South America, the distribution is maintained, and since the Neogene Mauritiinae palms are mostly restricted to swampy, lowland habitats.

Main conclusions
Morphometric analysis shows that since their origin Mauritiinae pollen are relatively species poor, and Mauritiidites resembles Lepidocaryum. We also conclude that the biogeographical history of the Mauriitinae and, by extension, tropical forests was strongly affected by global climatic cooling events. In particular, the climate change at the EOT was a fundamental determinant of current tropical forest distribution.},

	abstract = {Quantifying how land surface height, such as that of the Tibetan region, has changed with time is crucial for understanding a range of Earth processes, including atmospheric dynamics, biotic evolution and tectonics. Elevation reconstructions are highly uncertain and controversial, in part because of assumptions used in their calculation. The largest uncertainties are in the choice of unconstrained thermal lapse rates. Thermal lapse rates are defined as a change in surface temperature with altitude and have long been used to estimate paleoelevation. If we know both the lapse rate and the temperature at two sites at different elevations, then in theory we can calculate their height difference. There are different types of lapse rates (Dry, Saturated, Environmental and Terrestrial), yet which is the most useful for paleoaltimetry is unknown. Previous paleoelevation studies have often used observed modern-day global annual mean free air or terrestrial thermal lapse rates to measure elevation change, with the assumption that observed modern-day lapse rates are similar to those of the past. Here, using the HadCM3L paleoclimate model we demonstrate that Eocene global mean free air and terrestrial thermal lapse rates are not only different from the modern, but also show little predictive skill in reproducing prescribed model topography. Free-air lapse rates are largely insensitive to increased pCO2 (showing only a decrease of ∼0.1-0.5 °C/km), whereas lapse rates at Earth's surface, the most applicable for fossil-based paleoaltimetry, differed significantly locally and globally in the past compared to the Pre-industrial. This suggests that modern terrestrial lapse rate expressions are inappropriate for tracking altitude changes through geologic time. Moist processes and resultant moisture content of airmasses play a critical role in much of this uncertainty. The use of a wet-bulb temperature-derived lapse rate reduces this uncertainty significantly improving the predictive skill. Local terrestrial thermal lapse rates can be useful in paleoaltimetry, but only through climate model mediation where uncertainties can be reduced and quantified. Critically, paleoclimate models offer the opportunity to provide mean sea-level surface temperature to derive an elevation estimate where proxy-based values may not be available.},

	abstract = {To interpret pollen assemblages in terms of past vegetation, it is important to consider the source of pollen for any given lake profile containing sufficient pollen, and the way it arrives at its preservation site. It is of value to know the proportion of the pollen assemblage derived from the lake catchment and that which was airborne. This has been a long-neglected issue for lakes from arid areas of central Asia. In this study, we used two modified Cour (M-Cour) traps in different biomes (steppe and desert) to collect airborne pollen in the enclosed Balikun Basin during the non-flowering season (late autumn to early winter). The pollen assemblages from the traps are similar with large proportions of herbaceous and (sub-)shrub taxa such as Artemisia and Chenopodioideae. This implies a shared long-distance transport component, in addition to pollen derived from the local vegetation. These xeromorphic species are ubiquitous in the inland desert and/or steppe areas beyond the lake basin, and their pollen is likely to be carried by the wind into lake sediments from a broad area, leading to high percentages of Artemisia and Chenopodioideae pollen in lake surface-sediments. Pollen types from upstream areas (e.g. Picea, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae) are barely found in samples from the river mouth and lake surface-sediments. Thus, we speculate that the transport of pollen by inflow streams makes little contribution to the overall pollen budget in Balikun Lake. This is probably related to the low transport capacity of the surface runoff into the lake, as precipitation is low and there is limited meltwater from snow and glaciers in the surrounding mountains. Pollen assemblages from the near-shore lakebed, which have a high percentage of Chenopodioideae pollen (74.8\%), represent only the very local environment, reflecting the expansion of saline-alkali habitats rather than desert. Sedimentary archives from the near-shore lakebed will thus overestimate the desert Chenopodioideae pollen component and hence cause unreliable vegetation or climate reconstructions. We also found the local vegetation composition and pollen depositional processes could significantly bias the ratio of Artemisia/Chenopodioideae (A/C), reducing its effectiveness as an index to distinguish steppe from desert. We suggest using A/C ratios from lake surface-sediments which have a large airborne pollen source area in arid areas, as a better reference for down-core fossil pollen.},

Palaeogeographic maps covering six selected time slices, including the Middle Eocene, late Early Oligocene, late Early Miocene, early Middle Miocene, early Late Miocene and Middle to Late Pliocene illustrate that environmental and depositional differentiations on the northern platform and along the bordering domains of the convergence zone were more pronounced than on the southern platform and its adjacent areas. The tectonic evolution of the northern platform included an overall eastward-directed trend in the onset of basin uplift and emergence, which started at about the Eocene–Oligocene transition, at 34 Ma. Tectonostratigraphic analyses indicate a striking contemporaneity of the events which defined the temporal and spatial development of both the domains of the convergent plate boundary zone and the bordering platforms. Five episodes of major regional change in palaeogeographic and tectonic setting are distinguished. They occurred in the Late Eocene (37–34 Ma), early Late Oligocene (30–27 Ma), latest Early to earliest Middle Miocene (17–15 Ma), early Late Miocene (9–8 Ma) and late Early to early Middle Pliocene (4–3 Ma). These episodes encompassed changes which were most probably induced by geodynamic events primarily related to the relative motions of the African/Arabian and Eurasian plates. In turn, the plate motions are assumed to have ‘triggered’ discrete steps in the regional kinematics and geodynamics that governed the palaeogeographic evolution of the Peri-Tethys platforms and the intermediate domains of the African–Eurasian plate boundary zone.},

The frontal parts of this nappe directly overlie the northeastern margin of the Adriatic–Dinaridic carbonate platform, i.e. the External Dinarides. The evolution of the Central Dinarides was controlled by a sequence of tectonic events which took place within the Alpine cycle: (1) Rifting processes lasting some 40–50 Ma which started in the Late Permian and ended in the Norian. (2) Opening of the oceanic Dinaridic Tethys commenced in the Late Triassic and persisted for some 70–80 Ma until the end of the Jurassic. (3) Subduction processes and emplacement of ophiolites started in Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous times; during the closing phase of the `Dinaridic Ocean' (or Dinaridic Tethys) the Palaeozoic–Triassic nappe was emplaced on the ophiolites. The thrusting was accompanied by Alpine metamorphism (120–100 Ma). (4) The main Alpine deformational event and medium-pressure metamorphism with synkinematic granite plutonism took place in Late Eocene–Early Oligocene times when the ophiolite and Palaeozoic–Triassic nappes were emplaced on the Adriatic–Dinaridic carbonate platform which, at the same time, was deformed resulting in the development of the External Dinarides fold-and-thrust belt.},

The cessation of deformation is ascribed to rapid jump of the subduction zone at the passive margin rim of the opposite side of the accreted block. Geological investigation and 40Ar/39Ar dating on the main tectonic boundaries of the Anatolide–Tauride–Armenian (ATA) block in Eastern Turkey, Armenia and Georgia provide temporal constraints of subduction and accretion on both sides of this small continental block, and final collisional history of Eurasian and Arabian plates. On the northern side, 40Ar/39Ar ages give insights for the subduction and collage from the Middle to Upper Cretaceous (95–80Ma). To the south, younger magmatic and metamorphic ages exhibit subduction of Neotethys and accretion of the Bitlis–Pütürge block during the Upper Cretaceous (74–71Ma). These data are interpreted as a subduction jump from the northern to the southern boundary of the ATA continental block at 80–75Ma. Similar back-arc type geochemistry of obducted ophiolites in the two subduction–accretion domains point to a similar intra-oceanic evolution prior to accretion, featured by slab steepening and roll-back as for the current Mediterranean domain. Final closure of Neotethys and initiation of collision with Arabian Plate occurred in the Middle-Upper Eocene as featured by the development of a Himalayan-type thrust sheet exhuming amphibolite facies rocks in its hanging-wall at c. 48Ma.},

	abstract = {Thirteen time interval maps were constructed, which depict the Triassic to Neogene plate tectonic configuration, paleogeography and general lithofacies of the southern margin of Eurasia. The aim of this paper is to provide an outline of the geodynamic evolution and position of the major tectonic elements of the area within a global framework. The Hercynian Orogeny was completed by the collision of Gondwana and Laurussia, whereas the Tethys Ocean formed the embayment between the Eurasian and Gondwanian branches of Pangea. During Late Triassic–Early Jurassic times, several microplates were sutured to the Eurasian margin, closing the Paleotethys Ocean. A Jurassic–Cretaceous north-dipping subduction boundary was developed along this new continental margin south of the Pontides, Transcaucasus and Iranian plates. The subduction zone trench-pulling effect caused rifting, creating the back-arc basin of the Greater Caucasus–proto South Caspian Sea, which achieved its maximum width during the Late Cretaceous. In the western Tethys, separation of Eurasia from Gondwana resulted in the formation of the Ligurian–Penninic–Pieniny–Magura Ocean (Alpine Tethys) as an extension of Middle Atlantic system and a part of the Pangean breakup tectonic system. During Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous times, the Outer Carpathian rift developed. The opening of the western Black Sea occurred by rifting and drifting of the western–central Pontides away from the Moesian and Scythian platforms of Eurasia during the Early Cretaceous–Cenomanian. The latest Cretaceous–Paleogene was the time of the closure of the Ligurian–Pieniny Ocean. Adria–Alcapa terranes continued their northward movement during Eocene–Early Miocene times. Their oblique collision with the North European plate led to the development of the accretionary wedge of the Outer Carpathians and its foreland basin. The formation of the West Carpathian thrusts was completed by the Miocene. The thrust front was still propagating eastwards in the eastern Carpathians. During the Late Cretaceous, the Lesser Caucasus, Sanandaj–Sirjan and Makran plates were sutured to the Iranian–Afghanistan plates in the Caucasus–Caspian Sea area. A north-dipping subduction zone jumped during Paleogene to the Scythian–Turan Platform. The Shatski terrane moved northward, closing the Greater Caucasus Basin and opening the eastern Black Sea. The South Caspian underwent reorganization during Oligocene–Neogene times. The southwestern part of the South Caspian Basin was reopened, while the northwestern part was gradually reduced in size. The collision of India and the Lut plate with Eurasia caused the deformation of Central Asia and created a system of NW–SE wrench faults. The remnants of Jurassic–Cretaceous back-arc systems, oceanic and attenuated crust, as well as Tertiary oceanic and attenuated crust were locked between adjacent continental plates and orogenic systems.},

Cimmerian blocks were then accreted to the southern margin during the Mesozoic, leading to tectonic reactivation of older structures and discrete episodes of basin formation. The Indian and Arabian blocks collided with Asia during the Cenozoic, leading to renewed structural reactivation, intracontinental deformation and basin development. This complex evolution resulted in the present-day setting of an elongated Tien Shan range flanked by large Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary basins with smaller intramontane basins distributed within the range. The aim of this volume is to present multidisciplinary results and reviews from research groups in Europe and Central Asia that focus on the western part of the Tien Shan and some of the large sedimentary basins in that area. These works elucidate the Late Palaeozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the area.

The Greater Caucasus is a doubly verging fold-and-thrust belt, with a pro- and a retro wedge actively propagating into the foreland sedimentary basin of the Kura to the south and the Terek to the north, respectively. Based on tectonic geomorphology - active and abandoned thrust fronts - the mountain range can be subdivided into several zones with different uplift amounts and rates with very heterogeneous strain partitioning. The central part of the mountain range - defined by the Main Caucasus Thrust to the south and backthrusts to the north - forms a triangular-shape zone showing the highest uplift and fastest rates, and is due to thrusting over a steep tectonic ramp system at depth. The meridional orogenic in front of the Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan lies at the foothills of the Lesser Caucasus, to the south of the Kura foreland basin.},

Rifting putatively developed as a result of mantle plume activity that initiated under eastern Africa. The mantle activity has caused topographic uplift that has been connected to African Cenozoic climate change and faunal evolution. The rift is traditionally interpreted to be composed of two distinct segments: an older, volcanically active eastern branch and a younger, less volcanic western branch. Here, we show that initiation of rifting in the western branch began more than 14 million years earlier than previously thought, contemporaneously with the eastern branch. We use a combination of detrital zircon geochronology, tephro- and magnetostratigraphy, along with analyses of past river flow recorded in sedimentary rocks from the Rukwa Rift Basin, Tanzania, to constrain the timing of rifting, magmatism and drainage development in this part of the western branch. We find that rift-related volcanism and lake development had begun by about 25 million years ago. These events were preceded by pediment development and a fluvial drainage reversal that we suggest records the onset of topographic uplift caused by the African superswell. We conclude that uplift of eastern Africa was more widespread and synchronous than previously recognized.},

Uplift of the East African Plateau is linked to mantle processes, but paleoaltimetry data are too scarce to constrain plateau evolution and subsequent vertical motions associated with rifting. Here, we assess the paleotopographic implications of a beaked whale fossil (Ziphiidae) from the Turkana region of Kenya found 740 km inland from the present-day coastline of the Indian Ocean at an elevation of 620 m. The specimen is ∼17 My old and represents the oldest derived beaked whale known, consistent with molecular estimates of the emergence of modern strap-toothed whales (Mesoplodon). The whale traveled from the Indian Ocean inland along an eastward-directed drainage system controlled by the Cretaceous Anza Graben and was stranded slightly above sea level. Surface uplift from near sea level coincides with paleoclimatic change from a humid environment to highly variable and much drier conditions, which altered biotic communities and drove evolution in east Africa, including that of primates.},

	abstract = {Rift-ﬂank uplift adjacent to the Red Sea is asymmetric, i.e., a broad tilt of the entire Arabian plate along an axis parallel to the rift and more localized uplift on the African shoulder. A suite of models has been proposed to explain this pattern, but no model has considered the dynamic effects of large-scale mantle ﬂow. Recent high-resolution images from seismic tomography show a massive, anomalously slow shear velocity structure that emerges from the core-mantle boundary beneath South Africa and that reaches close to the surface at the Red Sea. This buoyant megaplume has been identiﬁed as the driving mechanism for anomalously high topography in southern Africa and rifting in East Africa; in this paper we investigate its role in present-day African-Arabian topography. In particular, we present predictions of dynamic topography based on viscous-ﬂow simulations initiated using seismically inferred mantle heterogeneity. These predictions demonstrate that viscous stresses associated with mantle ﬂow are responsible for the long-wavelength signal in African-Arabian ﬂank uplift. Our results do not preclude localized topographic contributions from other processes, particularly within the near ﬁeld of the Red Sea.},

	abstract = {The rapid melting of the Earth′s ice reservoirs will produce geographically distinct patterns of sea level change that have come to be known as sea level fingerprints. A basic, gravitationally self-consistent theory for computing these patterns appeared in the 1970s; however, recent, highly discrepant fingerprint calculations have led to suggestions that the algorithms and/or theoretical implementation adopted in many previous predictions is not robust. We present a suite of numerical predictions, including benchmark comparisons with analytic results, that counter this argument and demonstrate the accuracy of most published predictions. Moreover, we show that small differences apparent in calculations published by some groups can be accounted for by subtle differences in the underlying physics. The paper concludes with two sensitivity analyses: (1) we present the first-ever calculation of sea level fingerprints on earth models with 3-D variations in elastic structure and density, and conclude that this added complexity has a negligible effect on the predictions; (2) we compare fingerprints of polar ice sheet mass flux computed under the (very common) assumption of a uniform melt distribution to fingerprints calculated using melt geometries constrained by analysing recent trends in GRACE gravity data. Predictions in the near field of the ice sheets are sensitive to the assumed melt geometry; however, this sensitivity also extends to the far field, particularly in the case of Antarctic mass changes, because of the strong dependence of the rotational feedback signal on the melt geometry. We conclude that inferences of ice sheet mass flux based on modern sea level constraints should consider these more realistic melt geometries.},

Although glacial isostatic adjustment is generally accounted for, global scale dynamic changes in topography driven by convective mantle flow are generally not considered. We use numerical models of mantle flow to quantify vertical deflections caused by dynamic topography and compare predictions at passive margins to a globally distributed set of last interglacial sea-level markers. The deflections predicted as a result of dynamic topography are significantly correlated with marker elevations ({\textgreater}95\% probability) and are consistent with construction and preservation attributes across marker types. We conclude that a dynamic topography signal is present in the elevation of last interglacial sea-level records and that the signal must be accounted for in any effort to determine peak global mean sea level during the last interglacial to within an accuracy of several meters.

	abstract = {The monsoon system represents one of the basic elements of global atmospheric circulation. Its evolution and variability over long periods of geologic time play a significant role in our understanding of global climate. In this study, we focus on the Late Miocene interval from 10Ma to 6Ma, a period of postulated profound ecological and environmental shifts in East and South Asia. The combined approach of measuring planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios and stable oxygen isotopes from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1146 enabled us to reconstruct temperature independent seawater δ18O (i.e. proxy for sea surface salinity) variations in order to reconstruct the hydrography in the northern South China Sea. Located offshore the Pearl (Zhujiang) River, or its predecessor, the location of ODP Site 1146 is considered to provide a most sensitive record for detecting potential changes in freshwater input/river run-off as a result of changes in continental humidity, and hence changes in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) climate. Local seawater δ18O reconstructions reveal that monsoon development during the Late Miocene can be regarded as an abrupt weakening in the EASM around 7.5Ma. We suggest that an EASM weakening was most likely the driving force for decreasing aridity in East and South Asia at 8–6Ma, leading to widespread ecosystem changes in East and South Asia.},

	abstract = {We use new and published data to discuss the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) development and the relationship between the EAWM and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with special emphasis on the Holocene. The depth of the mixed layer in the northern South China Sea (SCS) is strongly modulated by the seasonal reversing monsoon winds with deeper vertical mixing during the winter monsoon season and less mixing during the summer monsoon season. Reconstructing the relative depth of the mixed layer thus represents a sensitive diagnostic variable of past changes in the EAWM strength. We derived estimates of the vertical thermal structure from the difference (∆T) in Mg/Ca-based temperatures between surface- (Globigerinoides ruber) and thermocline-dwelling (Pulleniatina obliquiloculata) planktonic foraminifera, and the temperature difference between alkenone and P. obliquiloculata in core MD05-2904 located in the northern SCS. Our ∆T estimates suggest enhanced upper water column mixing due to strengthened EAWM winds during the last glacial, consistent with other marine and terrestrial records as well as model simulations that also suggest a dominance of the cold and dry northwesterly winter monsoon system during the last glacial. Our ∆T estimates reveal that the EAWM was weaker during the Holocene compared to the last glacial. We find that EAWM and EASM changes show an inverse behaviour during the last glacial that is consistent with previous studies but co-varied during the Holocene. It can be inferred from these findings that the variability of the East Asian monsoon during the Holocene is more complex than the simple anti-phase relationship between summer and winter monsoon as assumed previously. The early-mid Holocene strengthening of both the EAWM and the EASM is most likely attributed to the higher summer insolation that resulted in a stronger seasonal contrast.},

	abstract = {Tectonics and regional monsoon strength control weathering and erosion regimes of the watersheds feeding into the Bay of Bengal, which are important contributors to global climate evolution via carbon cycle feedbacks. The detailed mechanisms controlling the input of terrigenous clay to the Bay of Bengal on tectonic to orbital timescales are, however, not yet well understood. We produced orbital-scale resolution geochemical records for International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1443 (southern Bay of Bengal) across five key climatic intervals of the middle to late Miocene (15.8–9.5 Ma). Our new radiogenic Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope time series of clays transported to the Ninetyeast Ridge suggest that the individual contributions from different erosional sources overall remained remarkably consistent during the Miocene despite major tectonic reorganizations in the Himalayas. On orbital timescales, however, high-resolution data from the five investigated intervals show marked fluctuations of all three isotope systems. Interestingly, the variability was much higher within the Miocene Climatic Optimum (around 16–15 Ma) and across the major global cooling ( 13.9–13.8 Ma) until 13.5 Ma, than during younger time intervals. This change is attributed to a major restriction on the supply of High Himalayan erosion products due to migration of the peak precipitation area toward the frontal domains of the Himalayas and the Indo-Burman Ranges. The transient excursions of the radiogenic isotope signals on orbital timescales most likely reflect climatically driven shifts in monsoon strength.},

Declining carbonate percentages together with a marked decrease in carbonate accumulation rates after 13.2 Ma signal the onset of a prolonged episode of reduced carbonate deposition. This extended phase, which lasted until 8.7 Ma, coincides with the middle to late Miocene carbonate crash, originally identified in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Interocean comparison reveals that intense carbonate impoverishment at Site U1443 ( 11.5 to 10 Ma) coincides with prolonged episodes of reduced carbonate deposition in all major tropical ocean basins. This implies that global changes in the intensity of chemical weathering and riverine input of calcium and carbonate ions into the ocean reservoir were instrumental in driving the carbonate crash. An increase in U1443 Log (Ba/Ti) together with a change in sediment color from red to green indicate a rise in organic export flux to the sea floor after 11.2 Ma, which predates the global onset of the biogenic bloom. This early rise in export flux from biological production may have been linked to increased advection of nutrients and intensification of upper ocean mixing, associated with changes in the seasonality and intensity of the Indian Monsoon.},

We integrated high-resolution benthic and planktic foraminiferal carbon and oxygen isotopes with Mg/Ca measurements of the mixed layer foraminifer Trilobatus sacculifer to reconstruct the isotopic composition of seawater (δ18Osw) and the gradient between planktic and benthic foraminiferal δ13C. A prominent increase in mixed layer temperatures of 4°C occurred between 5.55 and 5.28 Ma, accompanied by a change from precession- to obliquity-driven variability in planktic δ18O and δ18Osw. We suggest that an intensified cross-equatorial transport of heat and moisture, paced by obliquity, led to increased summer monsoon precipitation during warm stages after 5.55 Ma. Transient cold stages were characterized by reduced mixed layer temperatures and summer monsoon failure, thus resembling late Pleistocene stadials. In contrast, an overall cooler background climate state with a strengthened biological pump prevailed prior to 5.55 Ma. These findings highlight the importance of internal feedback processes for the long-term evolution of the Indian monsoon.},

	abstract = {Paleogeographic maps are essential tools for understanding Earth system dynamics. They provide boundary conditions for climate and geodynamic modelling, for analysing surface processes and biotic interactions. However, the temporal and spatial distribution of key features such as seaways and mountain belts that govern climate changes and biotic interchange differ between various paleogeographies that require regular updates with new data and models. We developed a reproducible and systematic approach to paleogeographic reconstruction and provide a set of worldwide Cenozoic paleogeographic maps at 60, 40 and 20 Ma. We followed a six-stage methodology that integrates an extensive review of geological data into a coherent plate tectonic model using the open source software GPlates. (1) We generated a global plate kinematic model, and reconstructed intensely-deformed plate boundaries using a review of structural, paleomagnetic and other geologic data in six key regions: the Andes, the North American Cordillera, the Scotia Arc, Africa, the Mediterranean region and the Tibetan-Himalayan collision zone. (2) We modified previously published paleobathymetry in several regions where continental and oceanic crust overlap due to differences in the plate models. (3) We then defined paleoshorelines using updated fossil and geologic databases to locate the terrestrial to marine transition. (4) We applied isostatic compensation in polar regions and global eustatic sea level adjustments. (5) Paleoelevations were estimated using a broad range of data including thermochronology and stable isotopes, combined with paleobotanical (mostly pollen and leaf physiognomy), structural and geomorphological data. We address ongoing controversies on the mechanisms and chronology of India-Asia collision by providing alternate reconstructions for each time slice. We finally discuss the implications of our reconstructions on the Cenozoic evolution of continental weatherability and review methodological limitations and potential improvements. Future addition of new data, tools and reconstructions can be accommodated through a dedicated interactive website tool (https://map.paleoenvironment.eu/) that enables users to interactively upload and download data and compare with other models, and generate their own plots. Our aim is to regularly update the models presented here with new data as they become available.},

	abstract = {There are two types of emerged relief on the Earth: high elevation areas (mountain belts and rift shoulders) in active tectonic settings and low elevation domains (anorogenic plateaus and plains) characteristic of the interior of the continents i.e. 70\% of the Earth emerged relief. Both plateaus and plains are characterized by large erosional surfaces, called planation surfaces that display undulations with middle (several tens of kilometres) to very long (several thousands of kilometres) wavelengths, i.e. characteristic of lithospheric and mantle deformations respectively. Our objective is here (1) to present a new method of characterization of the very long and long wavelength deformations using planation surfaces with an application to Central Africa and (2) to reconstruct the growth of the very long wavelength relief since 40Ma, as a record of past mantle dynamics below Central Africa. (i) The African relief results from two major types of planation surfaces, etchplains (weathering surfaces by laterites) and pediplains/pediments. These planation surfaces are stepped along plateaus with different elevations. This stepping of landforms records a local base level fall due to a local tectonic uplift. (ii) Central Africa is an extensive etchplain-type weathering surface – called the African Surface – from the uppermost Cretaceous (70Ma) to the Middle Eocene (45Ma) with a paroxysm around the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. Restoration of this surface in Central Africa suggests very low-elevation planation surfaces adjusted to the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean with a divide located around the present-day eastern branch of the East African Rift. (iii) The present-day topography of Central Africa is younger than 40–30Ma and records very long wavelength deformations (1000–2000km) with (1) the growth of the Cameroon Dome and East African Dome since 34Ma, (2) the Angola Mountains since 15–12Ma increasing up to Pleistocene times and (3) the uplift of the low-elevation (300m) Congo Basin since 10–3Ma. Some long wavelength deformations (several 100km) also occurred with (1) the low-elevation Central African Rise since 34Ma and (2) the Atlantic Bulge since 20–16Ma. These very long wavelength deformations record mantle dynamics, with a sharp increase of mantle upwelling around 34Ma and an increase of the wavelength of the deformation and then of mantle convection around 10–3Ma.},

This implies that terrestrial deposits along the southern Alborz mountains (leeward side of northerly winds and windward side of westerlies with the respect to Tibet and other mountainous terrain in the Himalayan–Karakoram realm) potentially track changes in past moisture and erosional regimes and mirror rainfall patterns. Here, we present results of a stable isotope analysis and clay mineral study of the Miocene (ca. 17.5–7.6Ma) Upper Red Formation in the foreland of the southern Alborz mountains. The changes recorded by stable oxygen and carbon isotope data from pedogenic and lacustrine/palustrine carbonate in the southern Alborz mountains suggest: 1) an increase in aridity possibly related to the evolution of the Alborz orographic rain shadow, which became more efficient between 17.5 and 13.2Ma; 2) a steady increase in precipitation between 13.2 and 10.3Ma with a significant increase in rainout along the southern slope of the Alborz mountains between 11 and 10.3Ma, possibly related to perturbations in atmospheric circulation pattern in the northern hemisphere as suggested by coeval wetter phases in southern Europe; and 3) a decrease in aridity from ca. 9.6 to 7.6Ma, possibly reflecting an increase in the seasonality of precipitation. Based on environmental and climatic changes observed across southern Asia and India starting from ca. 10Ma, we speculate that the topographic evolution of the Himalayan–Tibetan system might have affected the late Miocene climate in Middle East.},

The timing, rates, and regional changes in late Cenozoic deformation of the Talesh Mountains are not fully understood. In this study, we integrate 23 new apatite and zircon bedrock U-Th/He ages and structurally restored geologic cross sections with previously published detrital apatite fission track data to reconstruct the deformation history of the Talesh Mountains. Our results reveal that slow rock exhumation initiated during the late Oligocene ( 27–23 Ma) and then accelerated in the middle Miocene ( 12 Ma). These events resulted in the present-day high-elevation and curved geometry of the mountains. The spatial and temporal distribution of cooling ages suggest that the Oligocene bending of the Talesh Mountains was earlier than in the eastern Alborz, Kopeh Dagh, and central Alborz Mountains that initiated during the late Cenozoic. Late Oligocene and middle Miocene deformation episodes recorded in the Talesh Mountains can be related to the collisional phases of the Arabian and Eurasian Plates. The lower rate of exhumation recorded in the Talesh Mountains occurred during the initial soft collision of the Arabian-Eurasian Plates in the late Oligocene. The accelerated exhumation that occurred during final collision since the middle Miocene resulted from collision of the harder continental margin.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the Northern Hemisphere oceanic gateways has facilitated ocean circulation changes and may have influenced climatic variations in the Cenozoic time (66 Ma–0 Ma). However, the timing of these oceanic gateway events is poorly constrained and is often neglected in global paleobathymetric reconstructions. We have therefore re-evaluated the evolution of the Northern hemisphere oceanic gateways (i.e. the Fram Strait, Greenland–Scotland Ridge, the Central American Seaway, and the Tethys Seaway) and embedded their tectonic histories in a new global paleobathymetry and topography model for the Cenozoic time. Our new paleobathymetry model incorporates Northeast Atlantic paleobathymetric variations due to Iceland mantle plume activity, updated regional plate kinematics, and models for the oceanic lithospheric age, sediment thickness, and reconstructed oceanic plateaus and microcontinents. We also provide a global paleotopography model based on new and previously published regional models. In particular, the new model documents important bathymetric changes in the Northeast Atlantic and in the Tethys Seaway near the Eocene–Oligocene transition ({\textasciitilde}34 Ma), the time of the first glaciations of Antarctica, believed to be triggered by the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways (i.e. the Drake Passage and the Tasman Gateway) and subsequent Antarctic Circumpolar Current initiation. Our new model can be used to test whether the Northern Hemisphere gateways could have also played an important role modulating ocean circulation and climate at that time. In addition, we provide a set of realistic global bathymetric and topographic reconstructions for the Cenozoic time at one million-year interval for further use in paleo-ocean circulation and climate models.},

The δDprecip record is quantitatively coherent with, and δDprecip minima in phase with, greenhouses gas maxima, and ice volume minima across all orbital bands. The δDprecip record is also coherent and in phase with the two existing orbital-scale Indian speleothem δ18O records, demonstrating a consistent regional response among independent proxies.

Rather, they dominantly reflect changes in moisture source and transport paths associated with changes in greenhouse gases and ice volume.

	abstract = {The evolutionary history of organisms with poor dispersal abilities usually parallels geological events. Collisions of the Indian and Arabian plates with Eurasia greatly changed Asian topography and affected regional and global climates as well as biotic evolution. However, the geological evolution of Asia related to these two collisions remains debated. Here, we used Eranthis, an angiosperm genus with poor seed dispersal ability and a discontinuous distribution across Eurasia, to shed light on the orogenesis of the Qinghai–Tibetan, Iranian and Mongolian Plateaus. Our phylogenetic analyses show that Eranthis comprises four major geographical clades: east Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau clade (I-1), North Asian clade (I-2), west Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau clade (II-1) and Mediterranean clade (II-2). Our molecular dating and biogeographic analyses indicate that within Eranthis, four vicariance events correlate well with the two early uplifts of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau during the Late Eocene and the Oligocene–Miocene boundary and the two uplifts of the Iranian Plateau during the Middle and Late Miocene. The origin and divergence of the Mongolian Plateau taxa are related to the two uplifts of the Mongolian Plateau during the Middle and Late Miocene. Additionally, our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the central part of Tibet only reached an altitude of less than 2.3 km at approximately 40 Ma. This study highlights that organismal evolution could be related to the formation of the three great Asian plateaus, hence contributing to the knowledge on the timing of the key tectonic events in Asia.},

An attempt was made to isolate the effect of the Plateau uplift from the changes in other forcing mechanisms. We examined the spatial and temporal variation patterns of a variety of climatic variables and indices, including monsoon intensity, sea level pressure, surface and upper-air winds, temperature at different levels, precipitation, air humidity and soil moisture. Our results suggest that the evolution of the East Asia monsoon may be more sensitive to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau than that of the South Asia monsoon. Moreover, the effect of the Plateau uplift on the East Asia winter monsoon is more significant than that on the summer monsoon. In the northern part of East Asia (North China), the formation of the monsoon climate is marked mainly by the establishment of the northerly winds in winter, or the winter monsoon system, corresponding to the uplift of the Plateau when the height reaches approximately 50\% of its current elevation. On the other hand, the establishment of the monsoon climate in the southern part of East Asia (the Yangtze River valley and the area south of it) may be much earlier than that in the northern part.},

	abstract = {The impacts of Asian orography on the wintertime atmospheric circulation over the Paciﬁc are explored using altered-orography, semi-idealized, general circulation model experiments. The latitude of orography is found to be far more important than height. The Mongolian Plateau and nearby mountain ranges, centered at ;488N, have an impact on the upper-level wintertime jet stream that is approximately 4 times greater than that of the larger and taller Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas to the south. Key contributing factors to the importance of the Mongolian mountains are latitudinal variations in the meridional potential vorticity gradient and the strength of the impinging wind—both of which determine the amplitude of the atmospheric response—and the structure of the atmosphere, which inﬂuences the spatial pattern of the downstream response. Interestingly, while the Mongolian mountains produce a larger response than the Tibetan Plateau in Northern Hemisphere winter, in April–June the response from the Tibetan Plateau predominates. This result holds in two different general circulation models. In experiments with idealized orography, varying the plateau latitude by 208, from 438 to 638N, changes the response amplitude by a factor of 2, with a maximum response for orography between 488 and 538N, comparable to the Mongolian mountains. In these idealized experiments, the latitude of the maximum wintertime jet increase changes by only ;68. It is proposed that this nearly invariant spatial response pattern is due to variations in the stationary wavenumber with latitude leading to differences in the zonal versus meridional wave propagation.},

Our results suggest that after the Eocene–Oligocene transition, the climate became cooler and more seasonal causing the disappearance of subtropical elements.

In this paper, we present the results of a carpological and palynological study of the Kumyrtas flora collected from a flora-bearing horizon of the regional coal-bearing Zhilanchik suite, dated to the Aquitanian period. Pollen analysis identified 33 taxa, with are dominated by angiosperms (about 73\%) and reflect zonal vegetation. The high percentages of Betula (27\%) and Pterocarya (7.5\%) that were found in this flora allows comparisons with other Aquitanian floras of Kazakhstan. Based on descriptions of fossil fruits and seeds, we determined that 19 taxa were dominant; these taxa had meosphytic herbaceous components, suggesting mostly edaphic local conditions. The incongruence between the carpological and the pollen records suggests a significant taphonomical effect. Quantitative reconstruction of the palaeoclimate based on pollen records supports---and slightly extends---previous findings based on fossil leaf data, but contradicts findings deduced from the carpological record. Plant Functional Type (PFT) classification was used to characterize the vegetation patterns. Pollen records show that about 45\% of diversity relates to the arboreal broadleaved deciduous components and ca. 35\% to conifers. Fossil fruit and seed data indicate riverine vegetation with a high diversity of aquatic components and shrub stratum.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe Mongolian Plateau (MP), which is relatively lower in altitude and smaller in extent than the Tibetan Plateau (TP), has received little attention about its climate effect. Building upon previous work in which we highlighted the role of the MP on the high-level westerly jet stream, the response of surface-level features of the Asian climate is examined in this study. The results show that the Indian and East Asian summer monsoonal and inland precipitation are mainly enhanced by the uplift of the TP. The precipitation during the onset of the summer monsoon is also intensified over India and eastern China. In addition, the East Asian monsoon domain is significantly expanded with the uplift of the TP, while the Indian summer monsoon domain does not change obviously. The MP plays a significant role in the strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon, which is larger than the TP. With the uplift of the MP, the cold northerly wind in winter intensifies significantly in East Asia from higher latitudes to the South China Sea. The Siberian high is also enhanced and moves remarkably northward to its modern location. The strengthening of the Asian winter monsoon is related to the MP-induced diversion of westerly wind. The bypassing flows around the plateau modify the temperature advections over middle latitudes and the atmosphere thermal structure in winter, which leads to the strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon.},

	abstract = {The dating of the uplift onset of the Mongolian mountain ranges, the northernmost relief associated with the India-Eurasia convergence, is a fundamental issue to better understand the mechanisms of propagation of the Cenozoic transpressive deformation in Central Asia. Using apatite fission tracks we determined the timing and strain rates of the tectonics affecting the Gurvan Bogd system, in the Gobi-Altay, since the Middle Mesozoic to the Late Cenozoic. The region was firstly affected by a Lower–Middle Jurassic tectonic phase, characterized by a vertical crustal movement larger than 2 km. Then followed a protracted period without major crustal vertical movements until the last uplift phase. The peneplanation of the Jurassic relief produced an erosional surface that has undergone negligible denudation or sedimentation for more than 100 Ma. This same surface corresponds to the present summit plateaux of the massifs, standing about 2000 m above the surrounding region, which corresponds to the vertical movement produced by the ongoing uplift. Modelling of fission track data from the massifs of Ih Bogd and Baga Bogd shows that this uplift phase probably started at 5±3 Ma. The Gobi-Altay mountain range appears therefore as one of the youngest mountain ranges in Central Asia, which is consistent with the idea of a northward propagation of the transpressional deformation from the Himalayan front to the Siberian craton. The Cenozoic uplift rate of the massifs is estimated to be between 0.25 and 1 mm/yr, which is slightly higher than the upper Pleistocene vertical slip rates of the bordering faults. This suggests that thrust faults observed within the massifs would increase the uplift rate inside the massifs compared to the uplift rate determined at their boundaries.},

	abstract = {The Altai Mountains form an intracontinental, transpressive deformation belt in the NW Central Asian orogenic system. Using a multi-method chronometric approach, the thermotectonic history of the basement underlying the Teletskoye graben area is constrained in more detail. The results provide new insights into the Siberian Altai basement evolution from the Early Palaeozoic to the present. Zircon SHRIMP (sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe) U– Pb ages (Late Ordovician–Early Silurian, 460 –420 Ma) indicate an earlier crystallization age for the basement granitoids than previously thought (Late Devonian– Early Carboniferous, 370–350 Ma), while new multi-mineral 40Ar/39Ar age spectra suggest continuous basement cooling throughout the Devonian– Carboniferous. Reactivation of long-lived Palaeozoic structures controls the Teletskoye graben formation since the Plio-Pleistocene as a distant effect of India –Eurasian convergence. Deformation is propagated through Central Asia and Siberia along an inherited structural network closely associated with its basement fabric. A similar reactivation affected the Altai during the Mesozoic. Modelled apatite ﬁssion-track data suggest Late Jurassic–Cretaceous (150– 80 Ma) cooling, interpreted to be related to denudation and the tectonic reactivation that we link to the coeval Mongol–Okhotsk orogeny. From the Late Cretaceous until the Pliocene, the thermal history models indicate a period of stability. Roughly around 5 Ma ago renewed cooling is observed that possibly represents the denudation and growth of the presentday Altai, and provides the context for the Teletskoye graben formation. A modelled Late Cenozoic cooling can be a result of, or overemphasized by, a modelling artefact. Some caution should be taken not to overinterpret this cooling phase.},

	abstract = {The Qaidam Basin in the core area of arid Inner Asia has been considered undergoing continuous aridification over the Cenozoic. However, the Qaidam Basin is marked with expanded lacustrine sedimentation during the Oligocene, which contrasts with the fluvial or deltaic facies stratigraphically below (Eocene) and above (Miocene-present). The Oligocene lacustrine expansion challenges the idea of persistent aridification. To solve the conundrum, we reconstruct a long-term compound-specific hydrogen isotope (δ2H) record from sedimentary leaf wax n-alkanes to evaluate the paleoclimatic context before, during, and after the Oligocene lacustrine expansion. The δ2H results reveal three shifts at ca. 40 Ma, 34 Ma, and 24 Ma. The leaf wax δ2H values range from −176.8‰ to −166.7‰ from 51 to 40 Ma, followed by an abrupt increase of 23.9‰ at 40 Ma. We interpret this rapid increase as enhanced aridification due to the coeval retreat of the Paratethys Sea from the region. At 34 Ma, the δ2H plunges across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT). Post-EOT δ2H values are the lowest, vary with high amplitude from −187.1‰ to −153.2‰, and are associated with the lacustrine facies expansion, indicating a wetter climate. By compiling the regional isotopic proxy studies, we observe the contrasting patterns in paleohydrology conditions since the EOT: the relaxation of aridity in the westerlies region versus the enhanced aridification in the East Asian summer monsoon region. We interpret that the west-east contrasting patterns represent the different climatic responses to global cooling: wetting in the west as a result of the enhanced moisture transport via westerlies replacing the subtropical high, and drying in the east due to the reduction in moisture content associated with weakening East Asian summer monsoon. Wetting in Inner Asia is synchronous with cooling in the ocean (North Atlantic) and on land (Xining Basin). Since 24 Ma, δ2H increases in response to warming during the latest Oligocene to the early Miocene when the subtropical high re-occupied Inner Asia, causing the aridity. This study reveals a dynamic climate in Inner Asia with different mechanisms responding to global change.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104778},
	abstract = {Ancient lake deposits preserve detailed records of Cenozoic environmental changes, providing information on past climate, vegetation, precipitation and lake chemistry. This study focuses on palaeoenvironmental changes recorded in Eocene limnic environments across what is today the modern Tibetan Plateau. We describe a section dated as late Eocene (∼38-37 Ma) and integrate these findings within a regional context of similarly-aged Tibetan lake deposits across the plateau. These sedimentary archives of environmental change indicate a period of late Eocene aridification and cooling in the lead-up to the greenhouse-icehouse transition, which remains poorly understood in Central Asia. We show, based on geochemical, sedimentological, and palynofacies analyses, that a large saline lake existed within a semi-arid to arid steppe environment in the Nangqian Basin, east-central Tibet. The saline lake experienced cyclic drying intervals with shifts to a playa lake / mudflat system. Evidence of increased aridity is recorded in the upper part of the section, including a thinning of gypsum beds, decrease in palynomorph abundance, and concurrent increase in wood debris and amorphous organic matter. This is consistent with late Eocene aridity in Asia, drying of the playa lake, and an impoverished desert-steppe vegetation. Grain size data and geochemistry indicate a stable provenance of sedimentary material, suggesting that tectonic activity did not dominate sedimentation in east-central Tibet during deposition of these successions. Rather, palaeoenvironmental changes across the Tibetan region were most probably controlled by global climate oscillations and retreat of the proto-Paratethys Sea during the late Eocene: knowledge that is relevant for ecological interpretations through the Cenozoic, Quaternary and to the present.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103218},
	abstract = {Multiple stable isotope investigations from upper Eocene to lower Oligocene deep-water marine sequences record the transition from global greenhouse to the icehouse conditions (Oi-1 glacial). While Southern Ocean high latitude deep sea records of this transition are well known, their shallow marine equivalents are rare and have the potential to record the eustatic and oceanic consequences of Paleogene glacial variability. The well-known high paleolatitude ({\textasciitilde}55°S) neritic carbonate sequence at Browns Creek and Castle Cove in the Otway Basin in southeast Australia spans the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. During this time the area lay on the northeastern margin of the Australo-Antarctic Gulf facing the evolving Southern Ocean. The importance of this record has been hampered by a lack of a consistent stratigraphy and contradictory microfossil interpretations. To reconcile these issues we combine new bio-, chemo- and lithostratigraphic analyses of the outcrops and a new core (Colac-2) with pre-existing data to revise the stratigraphy. This confirms the middle/upper Eocene boundary is near the base of the section. The overlying upper Eocene siliciclastic strata are truncated by an unconformity (of {\textasciitilde}0.8 Ma in duration) and overlain by glauconitic sand (the Notrostrea greensand) deposited after {\textasciitilde}35.9 Ma. Subsequently deepening to middle to outer neritic depths deposited cyclic carbonates. Shallowing after {\textasciitilde}35 Ma deposited laterally variable calcareous siliciclastic facies. These strata were tilted and eroded prior to 34 Ma leading to shallow water facies that may have been subaerially exposed during uplift. Brachiopod strontium isotope dates and an 0.5‰ carbon isotope excursion above this unconformity suggests the top of the Browns Creek and the base of the Castle Cove section correlate to Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT-1) at {\textasciitilde}34 Ma. The subsequent persistence of positive C/O isotope values above this level records the transition to the Oi-1 glaciation at {\textasciitilde}33.7 Ma. Strong cyclicity in the inner shelf Castle Cove limestone is interpreted to record the commencement of obliquity dominated glacio-eustacy during the Oi-1 glacial phase. The shallowing from outer to inner shelf palaeodepths from the late Eocene to the early Oligocene is likely related to the onset of cryosphere expansion, however, palaeodepth estimates are complicated by the onset of regional compressional tectonism at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary that caused localized tilting and an unconformity with possible antisiphoning effects in this near-field site.},

	abstract = {Tectonic models for the Oligocene–Miocene development of the Himalaya mountain range are largely focused on crustal-scale processes, and developed along orogen-perpendicular cross sections. Such models assume uniformity along the length of the Himalaya, but significant along-strike tectonic variations occur, highlighting a need for three-dimensional evolutionary models of Himalayan orogenesis. Here we show a strong temporal correlation of southward motion of the Indian slab relative to the overriding Himalayan orogen, lateral migration of slab detachment, and subsequent dynamic rebound with major changes in Himalayan metamorphism, deformation, and exhumation. Slab detachment was also coeval with South Asian monsoon intensification, which leads us to hypothesize their genetic link. We further propose that anchoring of the Indian continental subducted lithosphere from 30 to 25 Ma steepened the dip of the Himalayan sole thrust, resulting in crustal shortening deep within the Himalayan orogenic wedge. During the subsequent ∼13 m.y., slab detachment propagated inward from both Himalayan syntaxes. Resultant dynamic rebound terminated deep crustal shortening and caused a rapid rise of the mountain range. The increased orography intensified the South Asian monsoon. Decreased compressive forces in response to slab detachment may explain an observed ∼25\% decrease in the India-Eurasia convergence rate. The asymmetric curvature of the arc, i.e., broadly open, but tighter to the east, suggests faster slab detachment migration from the west than from the east. Published Lu-Hf garnet dates for eclogite facies metamorphism in the east-central Himalaya as old as ca. 38–34 Ma may offer a test that the new model fails, because the model predicts that such metamorphism would be restricted to middle Miocene time. Alternatively, these dates may provide a case study to test suspicions that Lu-Hf garnet dates can exceed actual ages.},

	abstract = {The Miocene epoch, spanning 23.03-5.33Ma, was a dynamic climate of sustained, polar amplified warmth. Miocene atmospheric CO2 concentrations are typically reconstructed between 300-600ppm and were potentially higher during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (16.75-14.5Ma). With surface temperature reconstructions pointing to substantial midlatitude and polar warmth, it is unclear what processes maintained the much weaker-than-modern equator-to-pole temperature difference. Here we synthesize several Miocene climate modeling efforts together with available terrestrial and ocean surface temperature reconstructions. We evaluate the range of model-data agreement, highlight robust mechanisms operating across Miocene modelling efforts, and regions where differences across experiments result in a large spread in warming responses. Prescribed CO2 is the primary factor controlling global warming across the ensemble. On average, elements other than CO2, such as Miocene paleogeography and ice sheets, raise global mean temperature by ∼ 2, with the spread in warming under a given CO2 concentration (due to a combination of the spread in imposed boundary conditions and climate feedback strengths) equivalent to ∼1.2 times a CO2 doubling. This study uses an ensemble of opportunity: models, boundary conditions, and reference datasets represent the state-of-art for the Miocene, but are inhomogeneous and not ideal for a formal intermodel comparison effort. Acknowledging this caveat, this study is nevertheless the first Miocene multi-model, multi-proxy comparison attempted so far. This study serves to take stock of the current progress towards simulating Miocene warmth while isolating remaining challenges that may be well served by community-led efforts to coordinate modelling and data activities within a common analysis framework.},

	abstract = {The opening and closure of marine gateways have been suggested to substantially affect ocean current circulations and global climatic changes. In the Miocene, the closure of the Tethyan Seaway, which connected the proto-Mediterranean Sea with the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, blocked thermohaline exchanges between them and possibly caused a major climate change in the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition. However, the timing, process, and forcing mechanism of the closure of this seaway are controversial. To address this question, we focus on the chronology and sedimentary facies of Miocene strata in the Zagros foreland basin in the Western Iranian Plateau. Based on magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy, we establish a chronology of 17 to 10 Ma for the studied Miocene strata and constrain the timing of the permanent closure of the northwestern segment of the Tethyan Seaway to 12.8 Ma. By comparison with global sea-level fluctuations, we suggest that middle Miocene marine transgressions and regressions in the studied region were mainly driven by global climatic change through its control on the growth and decay of ice sheets and thus sea level changes. Our detailed depositional sequence analysis exhibits 100-kyr Earth's eccentricity cycles of marine transgressions and regressions between 15.0 and 12.8 Ma implying they were controlled by astronomical factors. Moreover, the Tethyan Seaway experienced stepwise evolution changing from partially opened seaway, restricted marine connection, intermittent connections, to permanent closure in its northwestern segment during the early and middle Miocene.},

	shorttitle = {The greening of {Western} {Australian} landscapes},
	abstract = {Western Australian terrestrial ﬂoras first appeared in the Middle Ordovician (c. 460 Ma) and developed Gondwanan affinities in the Permian. During the Mesozoic, these ﬂoras transitioned to acquire a distinctly austral character in response to further changes in the continent’s palaeolatitude and its increasing isolation from other parts of Gondwana. This synthesis of landscape evolution is based on palaeobotanical and palynological evidence mostly assembled during the last 60 years. The composition of the plant communities and the structure of vegetation changed markedly through the Phanerozoic. The Middle Ordovician – Middle Devonian was characterised by diminutive vegetation in low-diversity communities. An increase in plant size is inferred from the Devonian record, particularly from that of the Late Devonian when a significant part of the ﬂora was arborescent. Changes in plant growth-forms accompanied a major expansion of vegetation cover to episodically or permanently ﬂooded lowland settings and, from the latest Mississippian onwards, to dry hinterland environments. Wetter conditions during the Permian yielded waterlogged environments with complex swamp communities dominated by Glossopteris. In response to the Permian–Triassic extinction event, a transitional vegetation characterised by herbaceous lycopsids became dominant but was largely replaced by the Middle Triassic with seed ferns and shrubs or trees attributed to Dicroidium. Another ﬂoristic turnover at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary introduced precursors of Australia’s modern vegetation and other southern hemisphere regions. Most importantly, ﬂowering plants gained ascendancy during the Late Cretaceous. Characteristics of the state’s modern vegetation, such as sclerophylly and xeromorphy, arose during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. The vegetation progressively developed its present-day structure and composition in response to the increasing aridity during the Neogene–Quaternary.

	abstract = {Myanmar was shaped by the India–Asia collision, fusion of the Burma Terrane (BT) with Asia, and mountain building. Throughout this process new elevational gradients and habitats were formed, which affected the regional climate, but also forged new dispersal routes into Asia and India. In spite of its importance, the vegetation history of Myanmar is poorly known, and this hinders our understanding on the origins and evolution of SE Asian biodiversity. In this study we reconstruct the late Eocene flora in central Myanmar, based on samples from a sedimentary succession in Kalewa, and extend on the Sapotaceae fossil record with additional early Eocene–early Oligocene samples. We then study the morphology, botanical affinity, source ecology and biogeography of selected sporomorphs, and assess the Gondwanan and Laurasian components. Our results show that the Eocene palynoflora is representative for evergreen forests, typical in a seasonal wet climate, with dryer vegetation away from the area of sedimentation. The abundance of Sapotaceae further suggests that this family became an important component of the SE Asian flora shortly after the India–Asia collision. We conclude that the late Eocene geographic position and Gondwanan origin of Myanmar facilitated floristic exchange between the Indian Plate, BT, mainland and SE Asia, making the BT a crossroads for plant dispersals between Gondwana and Laurasia. The shift from late Eocene seasonal evergreen to present-day moist deciduous forests was likely due to the northward drift of Myanmar, the subsequent two-stage uplift of the Indo-Burman Ranges and posterior Neogene global cooling and drying.},

Here, we extend this analysis to a warm, almost ice-free climate with a different configuration of continents. We use the Earth system model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology to analyse the stability of the climate system under early Eocene and pre-industrial conditions. We initialize the simulations by prescribing either dense forests or bare deserts on all continents. Starting with desert continents, an extended desert remains in central Asia in the early Eocene climate. Starting with dense forest coverage, the Asian desert is much smaller, while coastal deserts develop in the Americas which appear to be larger than in the simulations with initially bare continents. These differences can be attributed to differences in the large-scale tropical circulation. With initially forested continents, a stronger dipole in the 200 hPa velocity potential develops than in the simulation with initially bare continents. This difference prevails when vegetation is allowed to adjust to and interact with climate. Further simulations with initial surface conditions that differ in the region of the Asian desert only indicate that local feedback processes are less important in the development of multiple states. In the interglacial, pre-industrial climate, multiple states develop only in the Sahel region. There, local climate–vegetation interaction seems to dominate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The first opening of the Bering Strait was an important palaeogeographical and biogeographical event for marine and terrestrial biotas in Asia and North America1,2,3, and an oceanographic event of global importance4,5,6. This event, however, has never been precisely dated, so it has not been accurately incorporated into models of global biogeography and oceanography. A recent find of the bivalve mollusc Astarte in southern Alaska is a clear signal that the strait had opened by at least the Late Miocene or earliest Pliocene epochs, because this genus otherwise dwelled only in the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans at that time1,2. Here we show that marine diatoms with Astarte are correlative with subzone b of the Neodenticula kamtschatica zone of the North Pacific diatom biochronology, yielding an age range of 4.8–5.5 Myr (refs 7, 8). Stratigraphic information suggests that this may be a minimum age range for the strait's first opening, which evidently occurred between 4.8 and 7.3–7.4 Myr ago. Our results contrast with past studies9,10,11,12,13 that suggested an age of 3.1–4.1 Myr for the initial opening of the Bering Strait.},

This unique 428-metre-thick Cenozoic sediment sequence preserves a critical piece of palaeo-environmental history: the advent of the Arctic Ocean in its current form. The gradual opening of the Fram Strait resulted in a change from a land-enclosed lake-like water body to an estuarine 'Black Sea type' phase with variable ventilation, and finally to the fully ventilated 'ocean' phase, some 17.5 million years ago.},

Closing the Panamanian Isthmus increased thermohaline circulation and enhanced moisture supply to high latitudes, but the accompanying heat would have inhibited ice growth. One possible solution is that enhanced moisture transported to Eurasia also enhanced freshwater delivery to the Arctic via Siberian rivers. Freshwater input to the Arctic would facilitate sea ice formation, increase the albedo, and isolate the high heat capacity of the ocean from the atmosphere. It would also act as a negative feedback on the efficiency of the “conveyor belt” heat pump.},

This Holocene−middle Eocene quantitative record of terrigenous sand accumulation on the Lomonosov Ridge, along with qualitative information on grain texture and composition, confirms the interpretation that ice initiation (sea ice and glacial ice) occurred ∼46 Ma in the Arctic, and provides a long-term pattern of Arctic ice expansion and decay since the middle Eocene. IRD mass accumulation rates range from 0 to 0.13 g/cm2/ka in the middle Eocene and from 0 to 0.36 g/cm2/ka in the Neogene. IRD mass accumulation rate (MAR) maxima in the Miocene and Pliocene cooccur with either glacial initiation or intensification in the sub-Arctic. The 46.25 Ma IRD onset in the central Arctic slightly precedes the earliest evidence of ice in the Antarctic, and compares in timing with a {\textgreater}1000 ppm decrease in atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The decline of pCO2 in the middle Eocene may have driven both poles across the temperature threshold that enabled the nucleation of glaciers on land and partial freezing of the surface Arctic Ocean, especially during times of low insolation.},

	abstract = {Extreme global warmth and an abrupt negative carbon isotope excursion during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have been attributed to a massive release of methane hydrate from sediments on the continental slope [1]. However, the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 °C [2],[3]) and rise in the depth of the CCD ({\textgreater}2 km; [4]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM, for which there are several potential mechanisms. Production of thermogenic CH4 and CO2 during contact metamorphism associated with the intrusion of a large igneous province into organic rich sediments [5] is capable of supplying large amounts of carbon, but is inconsistent with the lack of extensive carbon loss in metamorphosed sediments, as well as the abrupt onset and termination of carbon release during the PETM. A global conflagration of Paleocene peatlands [6] highlights a large terrestrial carbon source, but massive carbon release by fire seems unlikely as it would require that all peatlands burn at once and then for only 10 to 30 ky. In addition, this hypothesis requires an order of magnitude increase in the amount of carbon stored in peat. The isolation of a large epicontinental seaway by tectonic uplift associated with volcanism or continental collision, followed by desiccation and bacterial respiration of the aerated organic matter is another potential mechanism for the rapid release of large amounts of CO2. In addition to the oxidation of the underlying marine sediments, the desiccation of a major epicontinental seaway would remove a large source of moisture for the continental interior, resulting in the desiccation and bacterial oxidation of adjacent terrestrial wetlands.},

	abstract = {A 617 site palaeobotanical dataset for the Mid to Late Miocene is presented. This dataset is internally consistent and provides a comprehensive overview of vegetational change from 15.97 to 5.33Ma. The palaeobotanical dataset has been translated into the BIOME4 classification scheme to enable direct comparison with climate model outputs. The vegetation change throughout the Langhian, Seravallian, Tortonian and Messinian is discussed. The data shows that the Langhian, which includes the end of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, represents a world significantly warmer than today. The high northern latitudes were characterised by cool-temperate forests, the mid-latitudes by warm-temperate mixed forests, the tropics by tropical evergreen broadleaf forests and Antarctica by tundra shrub vegetation. Cool-temperate mixed forest existed during the Seravallian in the high northern latitudes, a reduction in warm-temperate mixed forests in the mid latitudes and a loss of tundra on Antarctica was noted. Tortonian vegetation distribution indicates that further cooling had occurred since the Seravallian. The major changes in vegetation include the first evidence for cold taiga forest in the high northern latitudes and a further reduction of warm-temperate mixed forests. By the Messinian, this cooling trend had eliminated warm-temperate mixed forests from the western USA and Australia and had formed mid-latitude deserts. Despite the cooling trend throughout the Mid to Late Miocene, the vegetation distribution of all four reconstructed stages reflect the vegetation of a world warmer than the pre-industrial conditions. The latitudinal distribution of bioclimatic zones suggests that the latitudinal temperature gradient for the Langhian would have been significantly shallower than at present and has gradually, but asymmetrically, become more modern towards the end of the Miocene. First the southern hemisphere distribution of bioclimatic zones became more modern, probably due to the climatic effects of a fully glaciated Antarctica. The northern hemisphere bioclimatic zone gradient continued to be shallower than modern throughout the Miocene and slowly became more modern by the Messinian.},

	abstract = {The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) is typically interpreted as a time of drastic global cooling and drying associated with massive growth of a glacial icecap in Antarctica and the shift to an “icehouse” climate. The effects of this transition on the terrestrial environments, floras, and faunas of the Southern Hemisphere, however, have been unclear. Here we document simultaneous changes in fire regime and plant community in Patagonia, Argentina. Decreases in the concentration of magnetite in loessites from the Eocene-Oligocene Vera Member of the Sarmiento Formation correlate with decreases in the fraction of burnt palm phytoliths as well as more consistently palm-dominated phytolith assemblages. Association of magnetite and burnt palm phytoliths suggests intense wildfires, which appear to have been suppressed for ∼200 k.y. shortly after the EOT. The disappearance of fire-related characteristics near the EOT is possible if changes in regional wind patterns—consistent with observed changes in sediment particle sizes—caused changes in seasonal precipitation. These results imply a more important role for fire in structuring Eocene-Oligocene landscapes than previously thought.},

	abstract = {A thorough understanding of the ecosystem factors that can act as drivers of vegetation change, an important factor for projecting impacts of future climate change, requires adequately distinguishing between plant community changes that occur on the local scale or over ecological time scales, and long-term trends. Phytolith assemblages have the potential to provide this information, but little work has been done so far to test their ability to do so in deep time. We examined vegetation patterns inferred from phytoliths (plant silica microfossils) from a single section of the Renova Formation, Timberhills region, Montana, dated to 39.2 ± 3 Ma (late middle Eocene). The section is composed of fluvial sediments overprinted by paleosols including Alfisols, Entisols, Inceptisols, and composite paleosols. Phytolith assemblages from 27 paleosol samples were used to reconstruct a high-resolution vegetation history for the area and were compared with paleosol data. Phytoliths are predominantly from forest plants and include tropical elements such as palms (Arecaceae) and gingers (Zingiberales), suggesting a paratropical forest. The high-resolution sampling records heterogeneous vegetation including shifts among closed forest, moderately open forest (forest gaps, edges, and woodland), and grass-dominated habitats. Grasses are interpreted as early open-habitat plants tolerant of drier conditions, but they appear to be replaced by forest vegetation with time, resulting in poor correspondence between paleosol type and phytolith assemblage at some stratigraphic levels, where paleosol morphology indicates a forest ecosystem and the phytolith assemblages indicate a changing grass-forest mixture as a function of depth within the profiles. This is the first study that has used phytoliths to construct a high-resolution record of vegetation from deep time, and we demonstrate that dense sampling and multiproxy approaches to paleoenvironmental reconstruction are necessary to capture vegetation heterogeneity in time and across microhabitats.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a general approach for analyzing siliceous microfossils from plants (phytoliths) in geologic sediments and uses this method to reconstruct the evolution of grasslands in the central Great Plains during the late Tertiary. Phytolith assemblage analysis is widely employed for reconstructing vegetation types in Pleistocene–Holocene paleoecology and archaeology, but no standardized methodology is currently available. Published phytolith studies are often system-specific and tailored after specific modern analogues. As a result, they vary in extraction technique, classification scheme, and method of inference. For ancient phytolith assemblages whose modern analogues are not well understood, a more general analytic approach is necessary. This analytic approach includes studying all size fractions (2–250 mm), using a classification scheme based on the available literature and a comprehensive modern phytolith reference collection, and comparing relative frequencies through time of all diagnostic phytoliths to interpret changes in habitat structure. This general method was applied to late Eocene to early Miocene sediment samples from northwestern Nebraska to deduce vegetation history and the results were compared to those obtained using a more specific technique [Strömberg, Paleogeogr. Paleoclimatol. Paleoecol. 177 (2002) 59]. In both studies, phytoliths were extracted by means of heavy liquid separation from the following lithostratigraphic units: (1) the late Eocene Chadron Formation and the early Oligocene Brule Formation (White River Group); (2) the late Oligocene–early Miocene Monroe Creek Formation, the early Miocene Harrison Formation and Anderson Ranch Formation (Arikaree Group); and (3) the early Miocene Runningwater Formation and Box Butte Formation (Ogallala Group). The two techniques, general vs. specific, produced results that differ markedly. Data from the general approach indicate the presence of relatively closed habitats in late Eocene to early Oligocene, typified by the presence of phytoliths from bambusoid grasses, woody and herbaceous dicotyledons, and palms. The introduction and spread of modern, open-habitat grasses, such as pooids, arundinoids, and panicoids, occurred between the late Oligocene and early Miocene. This resulted in a savanna or woodland type habitat by the early Miocene. In contrast, analysis using the specific method suggested the presence of open habitats in northwestern Nebraska from the late Eocene onward. The difference in interpretation based on the two approaches is principally due to inclusion of phytoliths {\textgreater}50 mm and the use of an expanded reference collection in the current study (general analytic approach). These results point to the importance of methodological choices in phytolith analysis and emphasize the usefulness of phytoliths as paleoecological indicators in the fossil record.},

	abstract = {Aim Frost is among the most dramatic stresses a plant can experience, and complex physiological adaptations are needed to endure long periods of sub-zero temperatures. Owing to the need to evolve these complex adaptations, transitioning from tropical to temperate climates is regarded as difficult. Here, we study the transition from tropical to temperate climates in the grass subfamily Pooideae, which dominates cool temperate, continental and Arctic regions. We produce a dated phylogeny and investigate the role of climate cooling in diversification. Location Global, temperate regions. Time period Cretaceous–Cenozoic. Major taxa Pooideae. Methods Using newly available fossils and methods, we dated a comprehensive Pooideae phylogeny and tested for the impact of palaeoclimates on diversification rates. Using ancestral state reconstruction, we investigated whether Pooideae ancestors experienced frost and winter. To locate the ancestral distribution area of Pooideae, we performed biogeographical analyses. Results We estimated a Late Cretaceous/early Palaeocene origin of the Pooideae (61–77 Ma), with all major clades already having diversified at the Eocene–Oligocene climate cooling (34 Ma). Climate cooling was a probable driving force of Pooideae diversification. Pooideae probably evolved in a temperate niche experiencing frost, but not long winters. Main conclusion Pooideae probably originated in a temperate niche and experienced cold temperatures and frost long before expansion of temperate biomes after the Eocene–Oligocene transition. This suggests that the Pooideae ancestor had adaptations to temperate climate and that certain responses to low-temperature stress are shared in extant Pooideae grasses. Throughout the Cenozoic, falling temperatures and expansion of temperate biomes were associated with an increase in diversification. However, complex mechanisms for enduring strongly seasonal climate with long, cold winters most probably evolved independently in daughter lineages. Our findings provide insight into how adaptations to historical changes in chill and frost exposure influence the distribution of plant diversity today.},

	abstract = {During Paleogene the Neotropical region was mainly covered by rainforests and ancient Amazon (AM) and Atlantic Forest (AF) were continuous and interconnected. The Andean uplift and drastic climate changes along the Eocene/Miocene resulted in the formation of a drier area separating AM from AF. However, multiple evidences have indicated recurrent connections between Neotropical rainforests during Quaternary. In this study we predict biogeographical connections between Neotropical Forests during the last glacial maximum (LGM—21 ka) and establish the climatic conditions that favored such connections. We tested if the general climatic conditions suitable to both Amazon (AM) and AF were uniform across current Cerrado and Caatinga areas or did subsets of these climatic spaces have independent spatial displacements connecting specific regions of AM and AF. For these, 50 occurrence points equidistant in the climatic space were sampled along the western and eastern AM and northern and southern AF and used to built ecological niche models (ENM) for each region. Potential distributions were predicted for the current and the LGM climatic scenarios using an ensemble approach. The ENMs detected the disjunct distribution of the two Neotropical rainforests in the present and showed three main connections during LGM: (1) climate suitable to western AM were detected along the northern coast of Brazil, overlapping the putative distribution of northern AF; (2) climates suitable to southern AF, northern AF and western AM were detected along the area now occupied by southern limits of the Caatinga and (3) the climate suitable to southern AF was found at the south limits of the eastern AM. Our findings suggest that subsets of both AM and AF may be considered distinct biogeographical units as implied by different responses to climate changes.},

	abstract = {Since 2012, we have investigated a stratigraphic section encompassing the late Eocene–earliest Oligocene interval at Shapaja (Tarapoto area, Peruvian Amazonia, ca. 7°S), through paleontological and geological fieldwork. The measured sedimentary series (120 m-thick [West] plus 90 m-thick [East]), assigned to the upper member of the Pozo Formation, records fluvial micro-conglomeratic lenses intercalated with floodplain and evaporite-rich fine red deposits, estuarine/coastal-plain tidally-influenced fine sandstones, and oxbow lake nodule-rich blue clays. This sedimentary shift coincides locally with the demise of the large Eocene coastal-plain wetland known as Pozo System. The late Eocene–early Oligocene Shapaja section was extensively sampled for chemostratigraphy (δ13C on dispersed organic matter and pedogenic carbonate nodules), which in turn allowed for refining the location of the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT) and other climatic events recognized at a global scale (i.e., Oi-1 and Oi-1a). The section has yielded nine fossil localities with plant remains (leaves, wood, charophytes, and palynomorphs), mollusks, decapods, and/or vertebrates (selachians, actinopterygians, lungfishes, amphibians, sauropsids, and mammals), documenting {\textasciitilde}130 distinct taxa. Four localities of the upper member of the Pozo Formation at Shapaja predate the EOT, one is clearly within the EOT, while four are earliest/early Oligocene in age. The small leaf impressions found along the Shapaja section could be indicative of dry and/or seasonal conditions for this region throughout and after the EOT. Monkeys, indicative of tropical rainforest environments, are only recorded in a latest Eocene locality (TAR-21). Two biotic turnovers are perceptible in the selachian, metatherian, and rodent communities, well before the EOT [{\textasciitilde}35–36 Ma] and a few hundred thousand years after the EOT [{\textasciitilde}33 Ma]. The latter turnover seems to be primarily related to a global sea-level drop (ichthyofauna: marine-littoral elements replaced by obligate freshwater taxa) and/or the onset of a drier and more seasonal climate in early Oligocene times (terrestrial components). Changes in the structure of the Shapaja paleocommunities were mostly driven by the flexural subsidence during the late Eocene, and then globally driven by the earliest Oligocene climatic deterioration.},

These transitions were driven by paleogeographic and global climatic shifts, but the respective roles of these shifts in the Asian climate remain unclear. Here, we use the low-resolution Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-L) and Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) to compare the effects of Tibetan Plateau (TP) growth, Paratethys Sea retreat and global cooling on the East Asian climate change that occurred by the early Miocene. The modeling results indicate that these three factors had clearly different climatic effects in East China. In particular, TP growth increased annual precipitation in East China, while Paratethys Sea retreat and global cooling generally decreased annual precipitation in East China. In addition, the three factors studied all drove aridification in inland Asia. Considering the increased precipitation, arid/semiarid-to-humid shift in vegetation and high plant diversity present in East China by the early Miocene, as shown in geological records, TP growth thus played a major role in these respects.

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopes from ocean sediments (δ18O) used to reconstruct past continental ice volumes additionally record deep water temperatures (DWTs). Traditionally, these are assumed to be coupled (ice-volume changes cause DWT changes). However, δ18O records during peak Middle Miocene warmth ({\textasciitilde}16–15 million years ago) document large rapid fluctuations ({\textasciitilde}1–1.5‰) difficult to explain as huge Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) volume changes. Here, using climate modelling and data comparisons, we show DWTs are coupled to AIS spatial extent, not volume, because Antarctic albedo changes modify the hydrological cycle, affecting Antarctic deep water production regions. We suggest the Middle Miocene AIS had retreated substantially from previous Oligocene maxima. The residual ice sheet varied spatially more rapidly on orbital timescales than previously thought, enabling large DWT swings (up to 4 °C). When Middle Miocene warmth terminated ({\textasciitilde}13 million years ago) and a continent-scale AIS had stabilized, further ice-volume changes were predominantly in height rather than extent, with little impact on DWT. Our findings imply a shift in ocean sensitivity to ice-sheet changes occurs when AIS retreat exposes previously ice-covered land; associated feedbacks could reduce the Earth system’s ability to maintain a large AIS. This demonstrates ice-sheet changes should be characterized not only by ice volume but also by spatial extent.},

	abstract = {A biome is a key community ecological and biogeographical concept and, as such, has profited from the overall progress of community ecology, punctuated by two major innovations: shifting the focus from pure pattern description to understanding functionality, and changing the approach from observational to explanatory and, most importantly, from descriptive to predictive. The functional focus enabled development of mechanistic and function-focused predictive and retrodictive modelling; it also shaped the current understanding of the concept of a biome as a dynamic biological entity having many aspects, with deep roots in the evolutionary past, and which is undergoing change. The evolution of the biome concept was punctuated by three synthetic steps: the first synthesis formulated a solid body of theory explaining the ecological and biogeographical meaning of zonality and collated our knowledge on drivers of vegetation patterns at large spatial scales; the second translated this knowledge into effective mechanistic modelling tools, developing further the link between ecosystem functionality and biogeography; and the third (still in progress) is seeking common ground between large-scale ecological and biogeographic phenomena, using macroecology and macroevolutionary research tools.},

	abstract = {The BIOME model of Prentice et al. (1992;J. Biogeogr. 19: 117-134), which predicts global vegetation patterns in equilibrium with climate, was coupled with the ECHAM climate model of the Max-Planck-Institut fiir Meteorologie, Hamburg, Germany. It was found that incorporation of the BIOME model into ECHAM, regardless at which frequency, does not enhance the simulated climate variability, expressed in terms of differences between global vegetation patterns. Strongest changes are seen only between the initial biome distribution and the biome distribution computed after the first simulation period, provided that the climate-biome model is started from a biome distribution that resembles the present-day distribution. After the first simulation period, there is no significant shrinking, expanding, or shifting of biomes. Likewise, no trend is seen in global averages of land-surface parameters and climate variables. Significant differences in the results of the climate-biome model are found when single-year and multl-year climatologies are compared regardless whether climate and biome model are used in an off-line mode or are interactively integrated. It is concluded that a biome model should be coupled with a climate model in the following way: firstly, the climate model should be integrated over several years; secondly, a biome distribution should be computed from the corresponding multi-year simulated climatology; finally, land-surface parameters are to be deduced from the biome distribution as boundary condition of the climate model for a subsequent integration, and so on until an equilibrium is established. Starting the climate-biome model from a biome map which drastically differs from today's global distribution of biomes, but keeping present-day ocean temperatures fixed, it takes several iterations until the model finds a new equilibrium differing from the present-day vegetation distribution in certain parts of the globe. This study indicates that the results of the climatebiome model are dependent on the initial land-surface conditions.},

	abstract = {We investigated the biogeography of Stigmaphyllon, the second-largest lianescent genus of Malpighiaceae, as a model genus to reconstruct the age and biogeographic history of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest (BAF). Few studies to date have focused on the tertiary diversification of plant lineages in the BAFs, especially on Stigmaphyllon. Phylogenetic relationships for 24 species of Stigmaphyllon (18 ssp. From the Atlantic forest (out of 31 spp.), three spp. from the Amazon Rainforest, two spp. from the Caatinga biome, and a single species from the Cerrado biome) were inferred based on one nuclear DNA (PHYC) and two ribosomal DNA (ETS, ITS) regions using parsimony and Bayesian methods. A time-calibrated phylogenetic tree for ancestral area reconstructions was additionally generated, coupled with a meta-analysis of vascular plant lineages diversified in the BAFs. Our results show that: (1) Stigmaphyllon is monophyletic, but its subgenera are paraphyletic; (2) the most recent common ancestor of Stigmaphyllon originated in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest/Caatinga region in Northeastern Brazil ca. 26.0 Mya; (3) the genus colonized the Amazon Rainforest at two different times (ca. 22.0 and 6.0 Mya), the Caatinga biome at least four other times (ca. 14.0, 9.0, 7.0, and 1.0 Mya), the Cerrado biome a single time (ca. 15.0 Mya), and the Southern Atlantic Rainforests five times (from 26.0 to 9.0 Mya); (4) a history of at least seven expansion events connecting the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest to other biomes from 26.0 to 9.0 Mya, and (5) a single dispersion event from South America to Southeastern Asia and Oceania at 22.0 Mya via Antarctica was proposed. Compared to a meta-analysis of time-calibrated phylogenies for 64 lineages of vascular plants diversified in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforests, our results point to a late Eocene origin for this megadiverse biome.},

Marine sedimentary records indicate a dramatic decline in pCO2 coeval with global cooling during the transition. However, terrestrial records are relatively sparse, with conflicting interpretations of hydroclimate in continental interiors. Here, we provide quantitative constraints on the response of the continental hydroclimate in the western United States across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary by studying clumped isotope temperatures [T(Δ47)], δ13C and δ18O values of vadose carbonates, and δ13C values of bulk organic matter (δ13Corg) in eastern Wyoming. Our results show that T(Δ47) dropped from ∼28 °C to ∼21 °C, indicating ∼7 °C cooling in air temperature, which occurred parallel to the decrease in atmospheric pCO2 during the latest Eocene–early Oligocene. We find that aridity and the biome were stable, and ice-volume–corrected precipitation δ18O decreased ∼1.6‰ across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, attributable to reduced vapor condensation temperatures. These new quantitative data add to the growing body of evidence suggesting a marked terrestrial response in temperature and hydroclimate across the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Our findings indicate a pattern of greenhouse-gas–induced global temperature change in the continental interior of the United States that was roughly 1.5–2× the magnitude of cooling in the global ocean.},

at both poles. Early Eocene polar landmasses supported extensive forest
ecosystems of a primarily temperate biota but also with abundant
thermophilic elements, such as crocodilians, and mesothermic taxodioid
conifers and angiosperms. The globally warm early Eocene was punctuated by
geologically brief hyperthermals such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal
Maximum (PETM), culminating in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO),
during which the range of thermophilic plants such as palms extended into
the Arctic. Climate models have struggled to reproduce early Eocene Arctic
warm winters and high precipitation, with models invoking a variety of
mechanisms, from atmospheric CO2 levels that are unsupported by proxy
evidence to the role of an enhanced hydrological cycle, to reproduce winters
that experienced no direct solar energy input yet remained wet and above
freezing. Here, we provide new estimates of climate and compile existing
paleobotanical proxy data for upland and lowland midlatitude sites in
British Columbia, Canada, and northern Washington, USA, and from
high-latitude lowland sites in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic to compare
climatic regimes between the middle and high latitudes of the early
Eocene – spanning the PETM to the EECO – in the northern half of North
America. In addition, these data are used to reevaluate the latitudinal
temperature gradient in North America during the early Eocene and to provide
refined biome interpretations of these ancient forests based on climate and
physiognomic data.},

Plant macrofossil assemblages from elsewhere in interior Africa for this time interval are rare, but new work at Chilga in the northwestern Ethiopian Highlands documents forest communities at 28 Myr ago. Initial results indicate botanical affinities with lowland West African forest. The earliest known woodland community in tropical Africa is dated at 46 Myr ago in northern Tanzania, as documented by leaves and fruits from lake deposits. The community around the lake was dominated by caesalpinioid legumes, but included
              Acacia

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of biomes has changed considerably over deep time, so the geographical opportunity for an evolutionary lineage to shift into a new biome may depend on how the availability and connectivity of biomes has varied temporally. To better understand how lineages shift between biomes in space and time, we developed a phylogenetic biome shift model in which each lineage shifts between biomes and disperses between regions at rates that depend on the lineage’s biome affinity and location relative to the spatial distribution of biomes at any given time. To study the behavior of the biome shift model in an empirical setting, we developed a literature-based representation of paleobiome structure for three mesic forest biomes, six regions, and eight time strata, ranging from the Late Cretaceous (100 Ma) through the present. We then fitted the model to a time-calibrated phylogeny of 119 Viburnum species to compare how the results responded to various realistic or unrealistic assumptions about paleobiome structure. Ancestral biome estimates that account for paleobiome dynamics reconstructed a warm temperate (or tropical) origin of Viburnum, which is consistent with previous fossil-based estimates of ancestral biomes. Imposing unrealistic paleobiome distributions led to ancestral biome estimates that eliminated support for tropical origins, and instead inflated support for cold temperate ancestry throughout the warmer Paleocene and Eocene. The biome shift model we describe is applicable to the study of evolutionary systems beyond Viburnum, and the core mechanisms of our model are extensible to the design of richer phylogenetic models of historical biogeography and/or lineage diversification. We conclude that biome shift models that account for dynamic geographical opportunities are important for inferring ancestral biomes that are compatible with our understanding of Earth history.[Ancestral states; biome shifts; historical biogeography; niche conservatism; phylogenetics]},

This new palaeoecological database and global vegetation reconstruction can be used both for the purposes of validating future palaeoclimate model simulations, as well as a land cover dataset to initialise palaeoclimate modelling experiments. Our Tortonian reconstruction shows significant changes in the distribution of vegetation compared to modern natural vegetation. For example in contrast to the modern scenario in the Northern Hemisphere, boreal forests reached 80°N and temperate forests were present above 60°N. Warm–temperate forests covered much of Europe, coastal North America and South-East Asia. Our reconstruction shows a spread of temperate savanna in central USA, the Middle East and on the Tibetan Plateau. Evidence for arid deserts is sparse, with the exception of the Atacama region (South America). Areas that exhibit arid desert today in the Tortonian were instead covered by shrublands, grasslands, savannas and woodlands. The extent of tropical forests in South America was likely reduced but expanded in the Indian sub-continent and East Africa. This pattern of global vegetation in the Late Miocene suggests a warmer and wetter world, which is supported by the pattern of climate anomalies predicted by our best-fit palaeoclimate-vegetation model experiment. Global mean annual temperature may have been as much as 4.5°C higher than present day with many regions experiencing higher than modern amounts of precipitation over the annual cycle. The pattern of temperature and precipitation change reconstructed palaeobotanically, and predicted within our climate model experiment, infers a global forcing agent on Tortonian climate (e.g. such as elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases) to explain the observed and modelled climate anomalies. This is in contrast to current proxy records of Tortonian atmospheric CO2 which range from Last Glacial Maximum to mid-20th Century levels.},

The reconstruction gives a more rigorous picture of climate and environmental change during the Middle Pliocene and provides a new boundary condition for future general circulation model (GCM) studies. Location Global. Methods Compilation of Middle Pliocene vegetation data from 202 marine and terrestrial sites into the comprehensive GIS data base TEVIS (Tertiary Environmental Information System). Translation into an internally consistent classification scheme using 28 biomes. Comparison and synthesis of vegetation reconstruction from palaeodata with the outputs of the mechanistically based BIOME4 model forced by climatology derived from the HadAM3 GCM. Results The model results compare favourably with available palaeodata and highlight the importance of employing vegetation–climate feedbacks and the anomaly method in biome models. Both the vegetation reconstruction from palaeobotanical data and the BIOME4 prediction indicate a general warmer and moister climate for the Middle Pliocene. Evergreen taiga as well as temperate forest and grassland shifted northward, resulting in much reduced tundra vegetation. Warm-temperate forests (with subtropical taxa) spread in mid and eastern Europe and tropical savannas and woodland expanded in Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts. Discrepancies which occurred between data reconstruction and model simulation can be related to: (1) poor spatial model resolution and data coverage; (2) uncertainties in delimiting biomes using climate parameters; or (3) uncertainties in model physics and/or geological boundary conditions. Main conclusions The new global biome reconstruction combines vegetation reconstruction from palaeobotanical proxies with model simulations. It is an important contribution to the further understanding of climate and vegetation changes during the Middle Pliocene warm interval and will enhance our knowledge about how vegetation may change in the future.},

	abstract = {The late Miocene is a time of strong environmental change in SW Asia. Himalayan foreland stable isotope data show a shift in the dominant vegetation of the flood plains away from trees and shrubs towards more C4 grasslands at a time when oceanic upwelling increased along the Oman margin. We present integrated geochemical and colour spectral records from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1456 in the eastern Arabian Sea to reconstruct changing chemical weathering and erosion, as well as relative humidity during this climatic transition. Increasing hematite/goethite ratios derived from spectral data are consistent with long-term drying after c. 7.7 Ma. Times of dry conditions are largely associated with weaker chemical alteration measured by K/Rb and reduced coarse clastic flux, constrained by Si/Al and Zr/Al. A temporary phase of increased humidity from 6.3 to 5.95 Ma shows a reversal to stronger weathering and erosion. Wetter conditions can result in both more and less alteration due to the nonlinear relationship between weathering rates, precipitation and sediment transport times. Trends in relative aridity do not follow existing palaeoceanographic records and are not apparently linked to changes in Tibetan or Himalayan elevation, but more closely correlate with global cooling. An apparent opposing trend in the humidity evolution in the Indus compared to southern China, as tracked by spectrally estimated hematite/goethite, likely reflects differences in the topography in the Indus compared to the Pearl River drainage basins, as well as the generally wetter climate in southern China.},

	abstract = {The Paleogene environment of today's semi-arid and arid Central Asia is poorly quantified and knowledge of the paleoelevation of northern Tibet remains elusive, yet both are crucially important for understanding inter-relationships between growth of the Tibetan Plateau and Asian monsoon development. Here, we apply the Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) and moist enthalpy method to the newly discovered early Oligocene (30.8 Ma) fossil leaves from the Qaidam Basin, to reconstruct quantitatively the paleoclimate and paleoelevation of this critical part of northern Tibet. We find the Qaidam Basin floor vegetation was likely at ∼3.3 ± 1.4 km in the early Oligocene, similar to that of the present basin floor but higher than the rising Himalaya at that time, and experienced a temperate, moderately wet climate. Near-freezing (1.4 ± 3.5°C) winters accompanied cool summers (∼23 ± 2.9°C). Annual precipitation likely exceeded 1000 mm (growing season precipitation of 1229 ± 643 mm) with subdued (non-monsoonal) seasonality in which summers were drier than winters. This finding challenges geodynamic models that envisage a Miocene or later uplift of northern Tibet and progressive uplift from the south.},

The distinct decrease of chemical weathering degree in source regions began at ϳ40.5 Ma, which is in agreement with the distinct decrease in redness of sedimentary sequences and the disappearance of thermophilic elements in pollen records. This 40.5 Ma cooling event extent demonstrated evidence for an intensiﬁcation of central Asian aridiﬁcation, which could be attributed to attainment of high elevations in southern-central Tibet and retreat of the Paratethys from central Asia in the late Eocene, reducing moisture transport to the Qaidam Basin.},

	abstract = {The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is an important geological event, but there is considerable controversy about its growth history. Different geological observations contribute to this controversial issue, while data from geochemistry, tectonics, and paleontology further fuel the debate. Vertebrate fossils have provided significant evidence for documenting the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the geologic past. The earliest fossil evidence recently collected from the Oligocene Dingqing Formation in central Tibet includes the climbing perch and cyprinine fish fossils whose modern close relatives are distributed in the tropical zone of Asia and Africa. These discoveries not only are significant for the phylogeny and zoogeography of fishes, but also imply that the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau was a warm and humid lowland at {\textasciitilde}26 Ma. The co-existing plant assemblage, which includes palms and golden rain trees among others, indicates that the warm and humid airs from the Indian Ocean could flow deeply into central Tibet, consistent with the inference from the fish fossils. Since that time, the geographical features and natural environments within the Tibetan Plateau have greatly changed. The Tibetan Plateau was consistently uplifted in the Early Miocene and reached an elevation of {\textasciitilde}3000 m, which was demonstrated by fish, mammal, and plant fossils. The endemic schizothoracines (snow carps) originated from the Miocene when the Tibetan Plateau turned into a barrier for mammalian migrations between north and south sides. A series of fish and mammal fossils provided unequivocal evidence that the Tibetan Plateau uplifted close to its modern elevation in the Pliocene and developed a cryospheric environment. As a result, the plateau region became the origination center for the cold-adapted Quaternary Ice Age fauna.},

It is believed that the opening of the Drake Passage had a marked impact on the cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Based on an Early Eocene simulation, we study the sensitivity of climate and ocean circulation to tectonic events such as the closing of the West Siberian Seaway, the deepening of the Arctic-Atlantic Seaway, the opening of the Drake Passage, and the constriction of the Tethys and Central American seaways. The opening of the Drake Passage, together with the closing of the West Siberian Seaway and the deepening of the Arctic-Atlantic Seaway, weakened the Southern Ocean Deep Water (SODW) dominated ocean circulation and led to a weak cooling at high latitudes, thus contributing to the observed Early Cenozoic cooling. However, the later constriction of the Tethys and Central American Seaways is shown to give a strong cooling at southern high latitudes. This cooling was related to the transition of ocean circulation from a SODW-dominated mode to the modern-like ocean circulation dominated by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).},

	abstract = {Abstract. Paleogeographic reconstructions are important to understand Earth's tectonic evolution, past eustatic and regional sea level change, paleoclimate and ocean circulation, deep Earth resources and to constrain and interpret the dynamic topography predicted by mantle convection models. Global paleogeographic maps have been compiled and published, but they are generally presented as static maps with varying map projections, different time intervals represented by the maps and different plate motion models that underlie the paleogeographic reconstructions. This makes it difficult to convert the maps into a digital form and link them to alternative digital plate tectonic reconstructions. To address this limitation, we develop a workflow to restore global paleogeographic maps to their present-day coordinates and enable them to be linked to a different tectonic reconstruction. We use marine fossil collections from the Paleobiology Database to identify inconsistencies between their indicative paleoenvironments and published paleogeographic maps, and revise the locations of inferred paleo-coastlines that represent the estimated maximum transgression surfaces by resolving these inconsistencies. As a result, the consistency ratio between the paleogeography and the paleoenvironments indicated by the marine fossil collections is increased from an average of 75 \% to nearly full consistency (100 \%). The paleogeography in the main regions of North America, South America, Europe and Africa is significantly revised, especially in the Late Carboniferous, Middle Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and most of the Cenozoic. The global flooded continental areas since the Early Devonian calculated from the revised paleogeography in this study are generally consistent with results derived from other paleoenvironment and paleo-lithofacies data and with the strontium isotope record in marine carbonates. We also estimate the terrestrial areal change over time associated with transferring reconstruction, filling gaps and modifying the paleogeographic geometries based on the paleobiology test. This indicates that the variation of the underlying plate reconstruction is the main factor that contributes to the terrestrial areal change, and the effect of revising paleogeographic geometries based on paleobiology is secondary.},

	abstract = {Long-term carbon cycle models are critical for understanding the levels and underlying controls of atmospheric CO2 over geological time-scales. We have refined the implementation of two important boundary conditions in carbon cycle models, namely consumption by silicate weathering and carbon degassing. Through the construction of continental flooding maps for the past 520 million years (Myrs), we have estimated exposed land area relative to the present-day (fA), and the fraction of exposed land area undergoing silicate weathering (fAW-fA). The latter is based on the amount of exposed land within the tropics (±10°) plus the northern/southern wet belts (±40-50°) relative to today, which are the prime regions for silicate weathering. We also evaluated climate gradients and potential weatherability by examining the distribution of climate-sensitive indicators. This is particularly important during and after Pangea formation, when we reduce fAW-fA during times when arid equatorial regions were present. We also estimated carbon degassing for the past 410 Myrs using the subduction flux from full-plate models as a proxy. We further used the subduction flux to scale and normalize the arc-related zircon age distribution (arc-activity), allowing us to estimate carbon degassing in much deeper time. The effect of these refined modelling parameters for weathering and degassing was then tested in the GEOCARBSULFvolc model, and the results are compared to other carbon cycle models and CO2 proxies. The use of arc-activity as a proxy for carbon degassing brings Mesozoic model estimates closer to CO2 proxy values but our models are highly sensitive to the definition of fAW-fA. Considering only variations in the land availability to weathering that occur in tropical latitudes (corrected for arid regions) and the use of our new degassing estimates leads to notably higher CO2 levels in the Mesozoic, and a better fit with the CO2 proxies.},

Des outils adaptés permettant de faire coïncider les sorties des modèles avec les données polliniques sont développés afin d’établir une distribution de probabilité associée à la reconstruction (échantillonnage de Monte Carlo et réseaux neuronaux). La méthode est validée avec les données polliniques actuelles d'Europe et d'Eurasie du nord : il est possible de reconstruire le climat actuel, avec parfois une marge d'erreur importante, à partir des données polliniques. L'erreur dépend en fait de la tolérance de la végétation à la variable climatique correspondante.

	abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentration has greatly fluctuated during the Quaternary. These variations have influenced the vegetation changes. The assumption that the relationship vegetation–climate sensu stricto was constant through time should be reconsidered taking into account the impact of the atmospheric CO2 content on the plants. Here we propose to use a process-based vegetation model (BIOME3) in an inverse mode to reconstruct from pollen data the most probable climate under precipitation seasonality change and under lowered CO2 concentration in the biosphere. Appropriate tools to match the model outputs with the pollen data are developed to generate a probability distribution associated with the reconstruction (Monte Carlo sampling and neural network techniques). The method is validated with modern pollen samples from Greece and Italy: it proves to be able to reconstruct modern climate with a more or less large error bar from pollen data. The error bar depends in fact on the tolerance of the vegetation to the corresponding climatic variable. The application to six pollen assemblages from Greece and Italy, representing the last glacial maximum (LGM: 18 000 14C-year B.P.), is done into three experiments: (1) modern CO2 concentration; (2) LGM CO2 concentration; (3) LGM CO2 concentration and high winter precipitation. The latter experiment is motivated by evidence of high lake-levels in Greece during the LGM which has been attributed to winter rainfall. These experiments show that winter was ca. 15–20°C colder than the present, in agreement with previous climate reconstruction. The apparent discrepancy between the high lake-levels and the steppe vegetation during the LGM, can be explained by an increase of the winter precipitation (which leads to high lake level) while the summer season is mild and dry (which affects the vegetation). The summer temperature has three stable states (−16°C, −10°C, −2°C), but the warmest one is the most probable if we take into account the lowered CO2 and the high lake-levels.},

	abstract = {Throughout Earth’s history, CO2 is thought to have exerted a fundamental control on environmental change. Here we review and revise CO2 reconstructions from boron isotopes in carbonates and carbon isotopes in organic matter over the Cenozoic—the past 66 million years. We find close coupling between CO2 and climate throughout the Cenozoic, with peak CO2 levels of ∼1,500 ppm in the Eocene greenhouse, decreasing to ∼500 ppm in the Miocene, and falling further into the ice age world of the Plio–Pleistocene. Around two-thirds of Cenozoic CO2 drawdown is explained by an increase in the ratio of ocean alkalinity to dissolved inorganic carbon, likely linked to a change in the balance of weathering to outgassing, with the remaining onethird due to changing ocean temperature and major ion composition. Earth system climate sensitivity is explored and may vary between different time intervals. The Cenozoic CO2 record highlights the truly geological scale of anthropogenic CO2 change: Current CO2 levels were last seen around 3 million years ago, and major cuts in emissions are required to prevent a return to the CO2 levels of the Miocene or Eocene in the coming century.},

	abstract = {Determining whether the high-latitude Bering land bridge (BLB) was ecologically suitable for the migration of mesothermal plants is significant for Holarctic phytogeographic inferences. Paleobotanical studies provide a critical source of data on the latitudinal positions of different plant lineages at different times, permitting assessment of the efficacy of the BLB for migration. Here we report exceptionally preserved fossils of Firmiana and Tilia endochrysea from the middle Miocene of South Korea. This represents a new reliable record of Firmiana and the first discovery of the Tilia endochrysea lineage in the fossil record of Asia. The occurrence of these fossils in South Korea indicates that the two lineages had a distribution that extended much farther north during the middle Miocene, but they were still geographically remote from the BLB. In light of the broader fossil record of Asia, our study shows that, in the middle Miocene, some mesothermal plants apparently inhabited the territory adjacent to the BLB and thus they were possibly capable of utilizing the BLB as a migratory corridor. Some other mesothermal plants, such as Firmiana and the Tilia endochrysea lineages, however, are restricted to more southern regions relative to the BLB based on current fossil evidence. These lineages may have been ecologically unable to traverse the BLB, which raises questions about the efficacy of the BLB as a universal exchange route for mesothermal plants between Asia and North America during the middle Miocene.},

	abstract = {Dendrophryniscus is an early diverging clade of bufonids represented by few small-bodied species distributed in Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest. We used mitochondrial (414bp of 12S, 575bp of 16S genes) and nuclear DNA (785bp of RAG-1) to investigate phylogenetic relationships and the timing of diversification within the genus. These molecular data were gathered from 23 specimens from 19 populations, including eight out of the 10 nominal species of the genus as well as Rhinella boulengeri. Analyses also included sequences of representatives of 18 other bufonid genera that were publically available. We also examined morphological characters to analyze differences within Dendrophryniscus. We found deep genetic divergence between an Amazonian and an Atlantic Forest clade, dating back to Eocene. Morphological data corroborate this distinction. We thus propose to assign the Amazonian species to a new genus, Amazonella. The species currently named R. boulengeri, which has been previously assigned to the genus Rhamphophryne, is shown to be closely related to Dendrophryniscus species. Our findings illustrate cryptic trends in bufonid morphological evolution, and point to a deep history of persistence and diversification within the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests. We discuss our results in light of available paleoecological data and the biogeographic patterns observed in other similarly distributed groups.},

All these areas belong to two biotic tracks, one stretching from Patagonia to the Peruvian coastal desert province, at approximately 5° South latitude in the Pacific coast of Peru and the second stretching on the coasts of the Atlantic ocean, from northern Patagonia to Caatinga. Twenty-one natural areas have been recognized and seventeen taxa of Arthropoda were analysed applying paralogy-free subtrees, using the TASS program. The obtained data matrix was analysed using NONA and TNT programs. The strict consensus tree shows that the first areas to become separate from the rest were Caatinga, septentrional deserts of Chile and Peru, the Uspallata-Calingasta Valley, and the natural areas from the western and eastern slopes of the Andes. The vicariant event most clearly correlated with the cladogram is the uplifting of the Andes mountain chain, which attained 3000m in the Quechua phase, between 14–11Ma in the middle Miocene. This event split, until present time, the taxa into occidental groups (from the central area of Chile) and oriental groups (from Argentina), and also generated the natural areas of Puna. The general area cladogram shows that Monte and Puna are not areas that were isolated from the rest and evolved separately, because the considered sub-areas are linked to other biogeographical provinces. The five areas that form Patagonia are all related.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms and processes underlying patterns of species distributions have intrigued ecologists and biogeographers for a long time. The Neotropics is the most species-rich region in the World, representing an excellent model for studying the drivers of diversification. In this study, we used a phylogenomic approach to infer relationships and examine the role of major geological and climatic events in shaping biogeographic patterns within Amphilophium (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae), a genus of Neotropical lianas. Even though Amphilophium is broadly distributed across the Neotropics, it is centered in Amazonia and the Atlantic rainforest. We generated nearly-complete plastome sequences for 32 species of Amphilophium, representing 70\% of the species diversity in the genus. The final dataset included 78 plastid-coding regions and was analyzed under Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to reconstruct the phylogeny of Amphilophium. We also used this dataset to estimate divergence times using a Bayesian relaxed-clock approach. We further inferred ancestral ranges, migration events, and shifts in diversification rates using a branch-specific diversification model and the Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC) model implemented in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Overall, we obtained a well-resolved and strongly supported phylogeny for Amphilophium, with five main clades that are well characterized by morphological features. Amphilophium originated in the Early Oligocene, and started to diversify in the Late Oligocene. The first diversification event involved a split between Amazonian and Atlantic forest clades. These two clades showed very different diversification scenarios. Divergence within the Atlantic forest clade began in the Mid-Oligocene, while the Amazonian clade underwent rapid diversification starting in the Late Miocene. In-situ speciation characterized the Amazonian clade, whereas allopatric speciation driven by migration events into other Neotropical biomes were mostly inferred within the Atlantic forest clade. The diversification of Amphilophium in the Neotropics was triggered by major geological events and changes in landscape that occurred during the Late Paleogene and Neogene, with little influence of the climatic changes of the Pleistocene ice ages. The divergence times and range inferences support the role of the Western Amazonian “megawetlands” and the formation of the South American “dry diagonal” as key climatic and geological barriers that separated the Atlantic forest from the Amazonian lowlands. Timing of migration events agrees with a Mid-Miocene closure of the Central American Seaway.},

	abstract = {The Paleogene succession of the Bohai Bay Basin (BBB), a highly productive petroleum basin in northeastern China with predominantly lacustrine fill, is poorly dated at present. Here, we generated an internal astronomical time scale (ATS) for the Paleogene strata of the Bohai Bay Basin (Dongying Depression, Jiyang Subbasin) using multitaper method (MTM) spectral analysis of high-resolution gamma ray logs. This ATS, which extends from 66 to 23Ma, is anchored to the standard geologic time scale by calibration to the Paleogene/Neogene boundary (23.03Ma) at the top of Dongying Formation. Based on this ATS, we recalibrated the ages of biozones, rifting episodes, and paleoclimate stages within the BBB. The recalibrated ages of rifting episodes and related fluctuations in sedimentation rates exhibit a close relationship to secular variation in production rates of Pacific oceanic plateaus and spreading rates of the Southeast Indian Ridge, confirming that the subsidence history of the BBB was significantly influenced by subduction of the Pacific Plate along the eastern margin of Asia and by collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. Age recalibration also facilitated re-evaluation of the relationship of sedimentation in the Bohai Bay Basin to the Paleogene climate history of East Asia, e.g., confirming a cooling and drying trend throughout the Eocene.},

	abstract = {Hydrology, source region, and timing of precipitation are important controls on the climate of the Great Plains of North America and the composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Moisture delivered to the Great Plains varies seasonally and predominately derives from the Gulf of Mexico/Atlantic Ocean with minor contributions from the Pacific Ocean and Arctic region. For this work, we evaluate long-term relationships for the past {\textasciitilde}35million years between North American hydrology, climate, and floral change, using isotopic records and average carbon chain lengths of higher plant n-alkanes from Gulf of Mexico sediments (DSDP Site 94). We find that carbon isotope values (δ13C) of n-alkanes, corrected for variations in the δ13C value of atmospheric CO2, provide minor evidence for contributions of C4 plants prior to the Middle Miocene. A sharp spike in C4 input is identified during the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum, and the influence of C4 plants steadily increased during the Late Miocene into the Pleistocene — consistent with other North American records. Chain-length distributions of n-alkanes, indicative of the composition of higher plant communities, remained remarkably constant from 33 to 4Ma. However, a trend toward longer chain lengths occurred during the past 4million years, concurrent with an increase in δ13C values, indicating increased C4 plant influence and potentially aridity. The hydrogen isotope values (δD) of n-alkanes are relatively invariant between 33 and 9Ma, and then become substantially more negative (75‰) from 9 to 2Ma. Changes in the plant community and temperature of precipitation can solely account for the observed variations in δD from 33 to 5Ma, but cannot account for Plio-Pleistocene δD variations and imply substantial changes in the source region of precipitation and seasonality of moisture delivery. We posit that hydrological changes were linked to tectonic and oceanographic processes including the shoaling and closure of the Panamanian Seaway, amplification of North Atlantic Deep Water Production and an associated increase of meridional winds. The southerly movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone near 4Ma allowed for the development of a near-modern pressure/storm track system, driving increased aridity and changes in seasonality within the North American interior.},
